"Yayınlanma: 15 Aralık 2022Raft Multiplayer and Online has a very critical security breach.That can be used to execute arbitraty code on your computer.The developers did not fix this breach so far, even thoug they were informed Months ago.This breach was found by the french Security firm Synacktiv.This breach is so critical, that i will not start the game until it is fixed.And i would recommend you to do so.Edit (03.01.23): On 22.12.22 the Developers published a patch with the patchnote:""We just wanted to let you know that we have just now pushed a small update containing a rework of the multiplayer network code, to increase security for hosts and clients.""They do not reference directly to this vulnerability. According to a Reddit User this patchfixes the vulnerability.Even if this fixes the vulnerability. Ignoring and closing bug reports for months, and only fixing critical security bugs after a security firm publicly informs the players about it. is very bad practice. Obviously the developer does not have the security of their players in mind but the bad press.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 20 Aralık 2022The game is absolutely great. That said, you shouldnt play it.The developer seems to have ignored a major vulnerability for several months that exposes anyone playing online to the most severe attacks imaginable(0 click remote code execution) by outside attackers(not the host, or another player, but anyone as soon as you are connected to any session). This can compromise your whole PC without you noticing anything and lead to someone else controlling your online banking, shops, credit cards or private conversations.That's not acceptable.I will not remove this negative review for any reason other than they are believably denying the vulnerability ever existed. Even if fixed, to have endangered all players in such a way for so long is not acceptable.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Aralık 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft is a barebones surival game with the niche of being on a raft. That is all there is to it. There are islands to stop on, sharks to kill, and a ""story"" of sorts, but it's really a shallow experience. Don't get me wrong, the amount of polish is astounding, the music and graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is engaging. It just doesn't have much to it. I love survival games, so I enjoyed it regardless. However, I cannot recommend it until it gets far more content. When it does, and believe me the delevopers care enough about their game to keep updating it, then I'll recommend the game for full price.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 10 Eylül 2022Raft is one of my favorite games. I like to play in peaceful mode for a relaxing time. Collect, build, advance.As a survival game, Raft strikes a reasonable balance between survival chores and fun. It's fun to figure out a sustainable path forward. That eventually gets tedious, then the next story location unlocks better technology to alleviate that. The game doesn't let you achieve full automation, but eventually the survival chores become somewhat infrequent.If anything makes the game lean toward the tedious side, it's probably the game's inventory system. Things like having to move items from your backpack to action bar, then select it as the active item, just to put the item in a device. Even when it might be the only place that item can go. Fairly obvious things are also missing. Like a sort button, grouping stacks of the same items together, pickups fill the action bar first then have to be moved to backpack by hand, sub-item crafting tedium. And generally the game recipes outsizing storage density, requiring lots of containers with similarly tedious management.There are some other rough edges. Edges, for example, are very easy to fall from. There appears to be no grace area or hint of being close. The edge also seems inconsistent based on the rotation and position of the object, so it's hard to develop a feel for it. I fall off the raft and other objects somewhat frequently, but I don't in other games. Progression is also stretched out too far. Several blueprints are found in the last area of the game. One after the story is all but finished. Also, a crafting material required for the last tier items is found in undersized quantities compared to recipe needs. So you are blocked from some of the most useful items in the game until the game is already over.Much of this is acceptable from a reasonably-priced game and an initial release from a new indie studio. But I recently discovered something that was unacceptable. I was in a situation where my internet was out, and I put Steam in offline mode to not use hotspot data. Periodically, the game would pop up an error and open a game menu. Ok, minor inconvenience, click Ignore and keep playing. Then I encountered a bug. When I had a container or inventory open when the error came up, the game would no longer take my inputs. I had to kill the game each time, losing progress. I reported the bug and tried to work around it. But then I ran into the worst part, which is not a bug. Being offline blocked me from progressing the story, because some game objects could not be interacted with. When I questioned support about this, they said I had to be online to play. Even in No One Can Join mode where there's no functional reason to be online or block story. (So it didn't sound like that bug would be fixed.) They pled ignorance as to why it was designed this way.The game's Privacy Policy makes the reason obvious: collecting your data. Among the ways they use your data, many of them are to weaponize your data against you for profit, aka marketing use. The policy also ensures Redbeet can collect your data by blocking access to the game you paid for, unless you make an account, provide personal info, and stay online. If you exercise your right to object or stop the data collection under the GDPR, Redbeet will revoke your license to use the game that you paid for.Support told me I could disable data collection in Settings. I recall this being a checkbox option at some point during Early Access, but it no longer appears to be. Now when I click the Open Data Privacy Page button as suggested by support, nothing happens. If I were a gambler, I'd bet this button simply opens their privacy policy, which enumerates all the ways users are blocked from having a choice in the matter.Because of this hostile ""privacy"" policy, I cannot recommend this game nor this studio.Update: Support told me that the Open Data Privacy Page is supposed to take me to Unity's data collection page. They didn't say anything about their own data collection.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 Haziran 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft is a game about juggling a constant stream of mundane and repetitive tasks.  You are never really given the freedom to relax, think, or explore, which does help to distract you from just how empty and shallow the game world truly is.  Indeed, I feel like the premise of the game was chosen specifically because it would be so easy to throw something together and have it ""work"".  Just grab a few models from an asset store, and voila--sea garbage.  No need for complicated landscapes and such.  Just an endless ocean chock full of trash.Your primary challenges include:* cooking and eating a potato every 2 minutes to not fall behind on hunger* desalinating water every 2 minutes to not fall behind on thirst or watering crops* planting potatoes every 6 minutes to not run out* chasing a demented, rabid seagul from your crops every time you step away* chasing a demented, rabid shark from your raft every 10 minutes or so, like clockwork* picking enough trash out of the ocean to feed recurring resource costs, since literally every action ultimately consumes some amount of wood, plastic, leaves, scrap, or stoneIf you want to do anything else, you must fit it into the above somewhere, severely limiting your prospects.Primarily, progression involves making the game a little less tedious.  For example, after 4-5 hours--at times forcing myself to continue--I was able to build a water purifier that could purify 5 cups of water at once, meaning I no longer had to ensure I was available at 2 minute intervals to start a new cup.  Around the same time, I got access to a grill that could cook 3 potatoes at once, with roughly the same effect.  You can also build nets that automatically collect trash that passes through them.  These things reduce the tedium a little, allowing you to juggle a greater number of tedious tasks, and no matter which chore you decide to focus on, you are always racing the clock to get back to some other chore.The game's mechanics are pretty much universally shallow and uninspired.  Take fishing, for example.  You drop a line, wait about 30 seconds, and press a button to claim your random item.  It does not matter where or how far you cast.  You can even drop your line straight through the floor of your raft.  You do not fish up anything interesting.  There are no baits, and upgrading your rod does not change the experience in any meaningful way.  This is representative of every other mechanic in the game.  The shovel, for example, cannot actually dig.  There is an animation for it, but the shovel is only used for collecting dirt from extremely rare resource gathering points, which you use only to grow grass.I understand this is early access, but I feel like the game's developers are missing a crucial component that should be baked into every game from day 1: fun.  There is a question that game developers should ask themselves before adding, removing, or changing anything, at any stage of development: does this make my game more fun?  If the answer is no, ABORT MISSION IMMEDIATELY! Games are about fun, and anything that does not improve fun in some way misses the point of the thing.  In Raft, the only mechanic that is even remotely fun is building your raft, and the developers have done everything in their power to ensure you rarely get a chance to do that.  This tells me they believe, like the developers of many disappointing games, that having ""things to do"" is a respectable goal.  It's not.  Having 1 fun thing to do trumps having 100 tedious things to do.  All the time, every time.  Though I would love to be proven wrong, I do not believe the developers will have an epiphany and reach this conclusion.  I made a good effort to find enjoyment in this game, but I simply cannot recommend it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 9 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiReview for version 1.01bRafts a pretty nifty little game, the idea of going along and strapping junk you collected to your floating home as you go is neat. However as of this version the gameplay is rather simplistic and overall unfun honestly.The GoodBuilding up my giant multi story wooden fortress was pretty fun and rather satisfying to see it come together.There was always something productive to be done like fishing, placing rugs, and ""exploring"" islands you drift into.Playing with friends ease's gameplay and makes it somewhat bearable.The BadThe shark is rather annoying, and will keep attacking your raft every few minutes. You can kill it but it just respawns after 30 or so seconds.Once you make a large enough raft, everything becomes trivial since youll have near infinite trash floating into nets placed along your raft.TLDRThe games overall playable, but lacks any real gameplay meat. For now I reconmend waiting out for a sale to drastically lower the price.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 10 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiIts a good game. But after a few hours of playing it you have researched everything and harvested every item you can. gets pointless. and the Shark acts like a robot. Its like clockwork with that shark. very unrealistic and becomes repetitive. even when you kill the shark. it reappears consistently every single time after 2 minutes. The islands are very unrealistic, tiny and difficult to access and they are not random gen. But the one that gets me the most is when you anchor down. the ocean stops moving. everything stops moving. the ocean is on pause while you are anchored. They have a good thing here. and with a decent amount of work this could be a very good game. but at the moment i feel like they are not working on large content updates. So maybe this game will be worth a buy in a couple of years. So at the current moment i do not recommend this game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 22 Kasım 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiAs some other commenters have said, it's not worth nearly $20 in its current state. It starts off interesting and then becomes repetitive and boring within a few hours. You float, expand your raft, find an abandoned raft, then find a deserted island. Keep floating, find another abandoned raft, and then another island. Do you find two islands in a row? Nope. You always find an abandoned raft and then an island in that order.The game feels like it's well made. Like if somebody cooked you a solid meal and then did not season or salt it at all. You can appreciate that it's not a poorly executed dish, but it still feels incredibly lacking. I understand it's in Early Access. If it was cheaper and had just a little bit more content and variety, I would give it a thumbs up at this point.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 27 Ekim 2022Offline single player needs to be addressed.  I've been playing over 300 hours (all solo) and this is the first I've tried playing away from an internet connection.Sad to say that the devs won't be transparent about why we can't play single offline.It doesn't matter that the artists intended for this to be a co-op game, saying a game is single player without allowing for offline play is dishonest.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 17 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game is fun and peaceful but right now there is just nothing to do.In five hours or so you can build everything there is to build, probably doable in 2 or 3 if you tried. There just isn't any content right now.There is one enemy in the whole game, the shark. He eats holes in the raft, other than that he's not a threat. His AI is terrible at hitting the player and with a decent spear you can kill him with very little effort. Not that it matters he comes back in about two minutes and he's really just there to annoy you.Way to many items don't do anything. Stone is for arrows (which you don't need) and the starter anchor. After you get the metal anchor stone is useless. Copper is only for electronic stuff once you make the antenna and the radio it's useless too. Glass is for two recipes only. Clay is only for making bricks. Way too many things are  only for one item when the game already has very few crafting recipes to begin with. All you ever really need is plastic, rope, planks, and scrap.I wish there was a ""meh"" option here. The game is ok, but right now for $15 it's just way too bare bones to justify it's price.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Şubat 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiBottom Line : Not Fun Without FriendsI really want to like this game. I really do. I agonized over or getting this game or letting it go for about a month before finally shrugging and thinking ""Meh its just 20 bucks.""A small part of me regrets giving up that 20 because this game is boring as heck.Early game is incredibly fun. It's harrowing standing there on your tiny af raft, desperately grappling for supplies to build a spear before the shark starts taking chunks out of the only thing keeping you alive. And the night time storms are nice to look at and experience...But I can tell you exactly when the fun ends. Once you craft the water purifier for fresh water, a grill to cook meat, and maybe the plant potter thing to grow potatoes. Not starving or dying of dehydration are your only real concerns. And once you attach net collectors to your raft even more worries evaporate, the raft will do the job of collecting trash for you!So what else is there to do? Not much. You can jump into the ocean and pick a fight with the shark but by the time you do everything I listed above the shark stops being a threat and becomes a nuisance. Even when you kill it, it respawns in about 5 minutes to annoy you again.I'm not impressed with late game content which is simply 'bigger islands with some animals on them' oh and those terrifying puffer fish. Screw those things. The end game radio tower seems to just be a place to find more scrap/materials but not much else. All in all its way too easy to fall into a rut because there is no story, 95% of gameplay is sitting on a raft and hooking stuff towards you or catching it in a net . This game is in DESPERATE need of some kind of quest system/dungeon system and an actual storyline.At best I can say Raft has an extended life span if you mess around with friends. But in the end, ultimately, you still get bored and it goes from a survival game to ""Pimp my Raft"" and the shark is just your biggest critic.  If you have no friends with this game then mess around with some mods.So no I can't recommend this game in its current state. Raft was a cool idea in concept that blew up like a balloon but what is inside that balloon is even thinner than air.Edit:  People in the comment section are making excuses that this game is in early access. No duh. I know that. It has been for nearly 2 years (it will be 2 years in may) and in 2 years, they've added more empty islands with bears on them, animals that only serve 1 purpose, and a ship.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Temmuz 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiUpdate after coming back after 1 year:No, I still cannot recommend the game. In fact, it is worse now.Raft started out as a chill survival game, with a little bit of challenge, you had to have some plan to what you were doing, get your priorities in order and then you were good to go.THE GOOD:1. Performance is now better, after 3h of playtime no FPS drops whatsoever, game runs stable. However, my gaming PC (with way above specs) runsreallyhot.2. Visuals, OST and story are nice, even though story is minimal and is told through notes from people that came before you, in certain points of the game. Gives it a nice touch of mystery and wants you to stay on for the story.3. Islands are now a lot better. There is always a bay where you can land without an anchor and you don't need to build a tower to reach the top of islands, there is always a way up. Also, spawnrate is good now.THE BAD:1. The game ishorrifinglygrindy.An example: The first fishing rod you can build, which needs a lot of resources, lasts for 10 fish. One fish fills you between 1/5 (the first you can find – means you need half a rod to fill your belly, which does not work, as you grow hungry quicker than your rod and the BBQ works) and 2/3 (the bigger fish - they have 3 portions you can eat +  you can only cook them on the bigger BBQ) of your hunger bar. The shark steak now only fills about 1/3, which is ridiculous. The only thing that fills up more is the cooking station, and it needs a lot of resources you won't be able to obtain for a while.I think this example shows pretty well what I mean. In a two player game on normal mode, one player is constantly farming for food, because recipes, which you can find, are rare and incredibly expensive to make, as you need a specialised tool for them.Same goes for building materials or any usables. My friend and me found ourselves grinding constantly to keep everything going, running from A to B, even with gathering nets, which auto-collect stuff from the water.Usables degrade super-fast. One dive with an oxygen flask? Say goodbye to 10% of it! Shoot the bow 10 times? 1/3 of it gone!So, the issue is, that all the new and improved stuff you can build does not really feel rewarding. Only the bigger BBQ and the bigger water still really feel like an achievement. The rest just feels like extra chore to maintain.2. Hence, I find that I can't enjoy the game. The ""chill factor"" of the game is gone, it is just one long hustle, until you get to the story points. And yes, again, I know, it is a survival game, hence, grind is to be expected, but at some point in the game there should be a baseline you establish, and not just running after the same chores that need to be done. In Raft, you need everything all the time.3. Balancing of the shark. This one is complicated. In the beginning, it is a welcome challenge. As soon as you manage to have an indestructible raft, it might as well not exist, as it does not attack whatsoever. It only attacks you when you are in the water.4. The big islands. Oh, bother. The big bird attacks relentlessly and hits you perfectly with stones, even if you dodge. I found it especially ""funny"" when he threw a rock at me from down below. Hitting with the clunky bow mechanic is tedious at best. It takes forever to draw it and the arrows fly too slow and too unpredictable. Hitting something with them is annoying and unnecessarily hard. And if you finally manage to kill the big bird, you don’t even get interesting loot!Apart from that, the big islands seem empty. Only some animals, not many new resources, everything is quiet and empty.5. Non-explained resources. For example, eggs. I expected to find them on big islands, but nothing after 3 or so. I then looked it up – super unintuitive!You need to catch a chicken with a net thrower, then tame it and then have a nesting place on your raft. Oh, and don't you forget to put it in a pen and feed it with one specialised thing, otherwise it dies after 10 minutes. So much time to figure everything out!Llamas are also a good example. You kill one, you get nothing. Llamas are edible in real life. How about some meat, if you missed the wool resource?6. As lifeless as the islands are, so is the water. No fish or other animals, except the shark and one other fish, with is extremely rare.7. Too little additions in the time the game had to grow. There are the big islands, yes, and some more story, yes, but it all still seems empty and the mechanics are crude. At this point, the game has nothing to offer but eternal grind and that is no fun for me.8. Distant view bug and completely dark night are still persisting issues.It seems to me that the devs of Raft really don't know where to go with the game. They are just sprinkling a little bit of everything into it, and none of it is done properly. Farming is grindy, the crafting system is meh, the combat system is meh and everything is complex enough that the manner of the game to not tell you anything about its mechanics makes it hard to advance.It breaks my heart to see the game go downhill like that. I loved how it started, but now all it is is a grindfest.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 17 Temmuz 2022This is a frustrating and sad review to write. I loved this game.  Loved, loved, loved. It could be as chill as I wanted, or as intense. I've come back to it time, and time again. Every so often I return, and play for hours, listening to the chill music, floating on the waves...But this latest update... I ... I hate it. I do not like platforming. No..  I HATE platforming. I don't buy games with heavy platforming, because it's not enjoyable in any way for me. It's frustrating, and I have no interest in rage gaming. I play to release stress - not add to it.WHY they decided, out of nowhere, to add a bunch of mandatory platforming in this latest update is beyond me. Absolutely nothing about it makes sense. It's bizarrely forced. The platforming areas don't even make sense. Why would the people of a town built above water build a series of rotating ""fans"" above platforms... fans that aren't even above anything so serve absolutely zero functional purpose at all. It's a crammed in, obvious, video game platform level in a game that otherwise has felt very organic (for lack of a better word) and not ""gamey"" at all. AND, if you ARE going to force platforming in your game, you BEST have tight controls and no collision issues. All this platforming did is really highlight how loose and clunky the games controls are, which was never a noticeable issue before.With this recent update, you want to play in ""Peaceful"" mode - that's out the window now, since there's a slew of aggressive creatures that ignore ""peaceful"" settings, forced mob fighting (you HAVE to fight mobs to get the items to progress), and forced boss fights. Boss fights. In Raft. Again... why they decided to shoehorn that in is beyond me. Boss fights in a game like this make ZERO sense to me. ESPECIALLY in peaceful mode.Don't offer a peaceful mode if your game doesn't allow it.To me the latest update absolutely feels like a different game entirely. It's like the developers saw what Subnautica Sub Zero did, and decided to try to cram that into their existing game. It doesn't fit. It's disjointed and jarring. It adds a level of difficulty and frustration to a game that did NOT call for it. The last areas are a different game, one I personally would not have bought.If you DO like platforming, jumping puzzles, and boss fights - then this may still be a good game for you.  But I do not.Before this update this game was a solid 8/10, maybe 9/10 for me. The newest areas are a 4/10 for me at best. So I guess I'm putting it away, incomplete, after over 170 hours of gameplay. I think I've returned to Raft for the last time.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 19 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiAfter playing this game for twenty five plus hours I can say that I had thoroughly enjoyed raft as a calming peaceful mix between subnautica and minecraft. The building aspect and the music makes for a peaceful and relaxing survival game but there are three reasons I cannot recommend this game; The first is the shark gets really annoying after awhile, the only way to deal with the shark is to either build armor onto your raft to prevent him from tearing it to pieces which takes a lot of scrap and metal ore and/or to kill the shark. The shark bait is kinda worthless because the shark is never satiated and always comes back sooner than you expect. The second is durability and food seems to drain really fast which can make exploring rough sometimes, and for some of the higher end items it feels like they are inconsistent with how quick they break for what they cost.The final reason is the most deflating, if you play on normal or higher end difficulties when you die you lose your entire inventory permanently. There is no means to be able to get it back which sucks and some deaths feel cheap, for example the death that made me stop playing happened when I found one of the big islands for the first time. I had just taken down a boar and was going to collect the meat when something hit me from behind, I looked up and couldn't see anything, I look around and couldn't see anything and then died. I opened my inventory to see all my tools, resources and food and water gone, so I thought hey let me go back to where I died and get my toolbar back at least. Arrived at the spot only to find out that it doesn't drop, only gets permanently deleted. To put this into perspective, every other survival game i've played allows you to at least try and get your inventory back, like 7 Days To Die, subnautica, starbound, etc..... It was so deflating because of the amount of effort it takes to build some of these items that I promptly closed the game and haven't reopened it since.On a side note: if you play on easy mode then your inventory doesn't get deleted. Over all it just feels like its unbalanced on normal mode and there's no warning about it.To the developers: I want to reiterate I really enjoyed the game, but I cannot emphasize how deflating it is to lose your entire inventory after 25+ hours of solo play with no warning or way to get it back, I think in normal mode it should drop so you have a chance to try and retrieve it.  As for the other things I mentioned I think a balance adjustment is in order, like the headlamp could last longer or have an option to recharge or be fed batteries, I also think the air tank and flippers could last longer as well for the resources they need to make or maybe bring the resource cost down, or better yet a repair mechanic that allows you to repair these items with substantially fewer materials instead of having to re-craft them every time.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 14 Eylül 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiITs a fun game in the beginning, but after a while it gets really repetitive and boring. it has a lot of potential though, i can see it becoming a good game in the future, but as it stands now, i really cant recommend it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Şubat 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI personally had a lot of fun for a couple of hours, but after you pass the beginning stages of Raft it becomes incredibly slow, especially if you're like me and don't have other friends to play with.Even after playing over 20 hours, I haven't found any animals but sharks and seagulls.I'd love to see more craftables and upgraded structures.More sail speeds would be amazing, it gets way too slow paced.On easy, slow down how often sharks spawn / frequency of attacksSteam workshop would be amazing for this game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Ocak 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI'm really split on this recommendation. I put 9 hours in with one of my kids (10) who's also a PC gamer.  In those 9 hours we have just about caught and built everything one can in the game. Devs are way to slow and really look more like they abandoned the game but occasionally post an announcement with some art to try to solicit new purchases (hey, they got me... I've watched this game since Aug/Sept and saw posts then. None of those came into the game).  They posted Dec 7, obviously hoping for some Christmas sales with the lure of ""see what we're about to add?! Buy it now!"".  Then they've done NOTHING.  Jan 21 now.  Oh, they occasionally pop on and respond to negative review (prob will to this one, too), which appears more of a ""keep sales/hope alive.""Is this game worth it???  That's the bottom line.  I do simple math with my kids on this stuff - cost of game divided by hours of play.   $20 for about 10 hours.  $2/hr.  I'd say no.  I tell my kids your goal in any game is that it cost you about $1 an hour.  You all can make your own call on that.  Ark Survival Evolved cost me about $100 (time I bought all the DLCs, etc.).  I have 4600 hours in it.  That's about 4.6 cents an hour - it was worth it. Red Dead Redemption 2 on XBox cost my son $60. The campaign/story was written to take about 60 hours.  $1/hr. Totally worth it.  And cost isn't everything, how much one enjoyed the game matters.  So that can factor in.   With Raft, I am left with the monotony, lack of choices (in building, crafting, taming, exploring, all of it), scarcity of materials ---and in the end, it's not getting any bonus for fun. If I weren't playing with someone else (my 10-year-old) in the open world format, it certainly would have been even less fun.  So I must give this a thumbs down.Devs - seriously, post the updates you keep saying you're going to, then maybe, maybe this game will turn around.  Stop trolling posts just to drum up sales with no plans to edit the game.And folks - seriously, one only needs to look at the game package to understand that what I'm saying is likely the case. The game is a whopping 350Mb to download.  Think about it and it's content.  Heck, the first draft of Ark was 4Gb and it's now around 40-60Gb.  The game clearly was made and launched minimalistically. And don't give me that Early Access Hate - WE ALL KNOW some devs drop trash on here, market well, and take our cash with no more effort into their games.  Sad, but it happens. All under, the... oh, hey, guys, this is Early Access, next year....",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 12 Şubat 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiVery fun relaxing co-op game, and super addicting. There's combat but it's mostly poorly implemented and not the point of the game. I love this game, but I have to give this a bad review as the game is a really awful ""early access"" offender. I played this game maybe two years ago and it's essentially the same thing now with a couple goofy walking-simulator quests that never seem to end and...animals. It has the same glitches, lack of content, and frustratingly bad design choices it always had.Let me break the lack of content down as it's the most glaring issue with the game:There are maybe 6 different very small islands you'll run into in the early game. You'll notice them repeating about 2 hours in. There's nothing else in the open ocean you'll run into. These islands aren't anything special and feel kind of shoddy, like somebody put them together in blender in a day. About 10 hours in there are 3 larger islands, also drab and fairly unimpressive. Comparing this to many games where you have to create an actual world map I am baffled as to how little effort there was made to populate this world. There's a handful of one-shot story maps later on but that doesn't make up for it.The developers do seem to care enough to at least work on this when they're bored, but I will never be able to understand why a massively successful game with a large community that loves it so much is so neglected by ungrateful devs.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 NisanExcellent co-op experience, but buyer beware!  If you don't like puzzles, this game's final 10 hours are ALL puzzles.

I can't do that unless I have internet somewhere.  That's there their solution and their too lazy to fix it so that you can play offline.

Kill a seagul over and over again.That is it...,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 13 Ekim 2018Edit. This review is outdated. I haven't played the game for couple years now and it has received several content updates since then.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL:DR at the bottom--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The premise for the Raft looks really promising. I enjoy playing unique survival games and Raft scratches that itch for me, though it doesn't come without its flaws.You start the game from the scratch on a tiny raft and with a single hook in your hand. You can't steer the raft (at this point yet) and you just go along with the waves gathering whatever materials you can and expanding your raft. Occasionally a shark attacks your raft and tries to tear it apart piece by piece, but you can fend it off if you have build the right tools.Like in every survival game you have to keep yourself fed and hydrated in order to survive. You get food from various sources like fishing for example, and drinkable water can be obtained by purifying saltwater. In order to do that you have to research and build water purifier.Talking about research, you can't build everything from the get go. You can only build the very basic structures, but the more advanced stuff needs to be researched first and to do that you first have to gather advanced materials which you can use to research new stuff at the Research table. I really like this feature, because it slightly adds depth to the game. As time goes on you can even build sails which allows you to steer your raft to where you want it to go.As I mentioned before, the game doesn't come without its flaws. There are various of small scale bugs every now and then, but in my opinion the biggest flaw is the lack of content. There's just not much that you can do in this game yet. At the time of writing this, I've clocked in roughly 8 hours and I've already experienced (almost) everything that the game has to offer. The only thing that I haven't experienced yet is the recently added Large island which I haven't found yet.Building is interesting, but after couple hours of playing you've pretty much builded everything that there is to build.Surviving is super easy after getting used to it, because there aren't many enemies or hazards that can threaten your life. The only way you can die is to die from hunger/thirst, drowning or getting eaten by shark. Food and water are never really a problem, because you can get both of them pretty easily and the shark is an annoyance at most. After a while I even stopped caring about the shark entirely and kept diving in the ocean for materials. The only time I pay attention to the shark is when its attacking my raft.The game lacks in locations too. You can explore small/large islands, abandoned rafts and even rigs if you find them, but there's nothing exciting in them after you've seen them once. The game needs more interesting locations that you can find and explore.But the game is still in early-access and the developers keep adding more stuff to it as time goes on. I only wish that they triple or even quadruple the content by the time the game gets released, because I want to get more people playing this in the future. I hope to see stuff like ocean floor exploration, various creatures like giant octo♥♥♥♥♥ attacking your raft, big islands with tons of rare materials to find, new hazards etc.The premise looks really promising for this game and only the imagination is the limit.Pros:+ Waterworld theme+ Survival mechanics+ Raft BuildingCons:- Not much to do yet- Lack of locations to explore- Lack of enemies and hazards- Lack of building strugtures and objectives- Extremely short research progression- Various (early-access) bugsDo I recommend?Not in its current early-access state. But if the developers triple or even quadruple the current content by the time of the version 1.0 release, then in that case I do recommend this. The premise for this game looks really promising and I hope the developers don't lose the passion while making it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL:DR - I like the game, but can't recommend ityetbecause of it's lack of content",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 22 Aralık 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiI finally finished the story, and it was bad enough to change my review entirely.Raft's basic game loop is a simple resource-collecting base builder style survival game, with the twist that the base actually moves. It changes the usual farm/mine paradigm most basebuilders fall into because you have to be able to take everything with you.However, Raft also has a story spanning eight islands, which you must pursue in order to unlock recipes to improve your raft into a fairly impressive paddlesteamer. In Early Access the first five islands had its own story, with only a few connections. Now, with the official release and the last three islands, we have something else. The story follows an old white man who raises an army of rabid, trained animals to force discipline and order on the very non-white inhabitants of Utopia.He has no motive, no rationale, no plan. He just throws everyone people in a cage and waits for you at the end of a jumping puzzle petting his rabid, radioactive hyena and occasionally throwing grenades at you. Then he tangles his feet in a cable, falls out a window, and ends the game hanging upside down like a particularly undignified pinata. Then you free a few dozen people from an unguarded cage secured by a padlock that no one was smart enough to just break open.I'm not kidding. This is what Raft's story is. It's stupid, it has nothing to do with the gameplay that is the game's main draw, it's deeply unsatisfying, and it cheapens the entire experience.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Aralık 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiExcited to play the game with my friend this weekend, to see what the developers has added in their latest release. Will edit my review afterwards!_________Base game is very unique and has huge potential. Main problem are the developers not investing in quantity. The game development is moving at very slow speed, and we lack proper (STEADY) content releases. This makes the game quickly become boring, and you hit a wall once you've built/done everything in 6-9 hours.Games such as The Forest managed to role out big updates every second week as a small team. These guys does not even come close to 20% of the same effort. I know i sound harsh towards the creators, but i want this game to succeed, not to die before it comes out of early access.Step up, you should have the resources to hire more people to your team.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Haziran 2022So the first few islands are great, and the survival mechanics, while a bit of a grind, aren't bad and can actually be fun.  The first few updates of the game were also very enjoyable.  My wife and I have played through the early stages of the game multiple times, and really enjoyed all the improvements and new content.  A few weeks ago I would have emphatically recommended this game to everyone.However, the latest release is a total departure from the core game play which is essentially ""surviving on the raft"", hence the name ""Raft"".  The plot is nonsensical, but in the early releases really didn't matter much as it really didn't affect game play.  The new section of the game forces you to pay attention and it's not worth it.  Worse the last three islands are jam packed with meaningless time wasters and ill-contrived puzzles.To put it plainly, the ""final"" release breaks the original feel of the game so badly that it taints the rest of the experience.  It started out as Robinson Crusoe at see and ends up... well for the sake of not spoiling anything I won't finish that statement.  I'll just add that at one point it becomes a platformer, and I will spoil this, the control and collision system is not accurate enough for *any kind* of fun platforming experience.It feels as if the devs got bored making a survival game and crammed in a bunch of content that simply doesn't fit.  Seriously, there are highly mechanical boss fights now, extremely annoying platforming, slap-dash puzzles and poorly implemented control systems.I may be wrong, and this might have been the plan all along.  If so, it wasn't a good plan.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Ekim 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game's pacing and gameplay loop are fairly relaxing and fun. Collecting resources to slowly expand your raft, looting islands for materials, researching how to craft new better gear, and of course fighting off the shark. The shark's implementation is damn good. The shark is essentially an omnipresent terror that forces your progress and is constantly played around. The shark prevents you from swimming to grab new resources as it snaps at you when you are off of your raft, the shark will gnaw at the edges of your raft on occasion forcing you to fend it off. Eventually you discover that some of the most valuable resources are underwater on islands, requiring you to face your fear and figure out how to deal with the shark. The game understandably offers several ways for “countering” the shark, you can craft shark bait and hurl it into the water distracting it for a while, you can straight up kill the shark delaying its attacks for a while, or you can try to avoid it (which I really wouldn’t suggest). Overall the game seems fairly well thought out until large islands come along at least.The strength of the game is not in its combat system, argumentably speaking it doesn’t even have a combat system. Spears carry no weight to their blows, and arrows are functionally pool noodles that lazily float through the air before hopefully hitting their mark. Now this is enough to usually fend off a shark as it is a single minded target that’s either standing perfectly still, or heading straight towards you, and the occasional seagull which also, sits astoundingly still however after you find the radio tower you run into a severe problem. The large islands within the game have actual enemies you have to face besides the shark, this sounds interesting and sounds like a great way to up the stakes since the islands themselves can carry livestock and thus allow you to progress even further but that’s easier said than done. The three enemies are pufferfish, boars and shriekers. Boars are literally large boars that charge you whenever they can, you can evade their charges by dancing around them and hit them from a safe distance with your pool noodles, I have yet to deal with pufferfish, and shriekers are actually hell. Being a flying enemy shriekers require the bow to take out, or the spear when they land. Their only form of attack is flying over you and dropping a rock on your head, it’s fairly simple to dodge but the problem is getting rid of the shrieker. You pretty much HAVE to wait for it to almost drop the rock on your head, or sprint around the island dodging boars and shoot it with the painfully slow bow everytime it lands. This is understandably incredibly frustrating. I’m not sure why they tried to implement combat is such a blatant fashion considering it’s such a long shot from the games actual strengths. It feels haphazardly tacked on to add something “new”.Honestly, I’d recommend it now but I’m so frustrated at how poorly implemented the combat system is that I’m now forced to use that I’m leaving it a negative review. It would be interesting if we could make shrieker bait or boar bait to distract them while we quickly scavenge the island for resources, and would fit with the rest of their design philosophy. However currently as that is not the case, and I am still forced to use the poorly implemented combat system I will continue to be unendingly frustrated by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ birds. Seriously ♥♥♥♥ birds.Rant aside the game has very few to no game breaking bugs, so far the worst bug I’ve found was that the shark occasionally will attack the center of the boat, which… I don’t think it’s supposed to do, the animation looks really bad and it clips all over the place so I’m assuming that’s unintentional.For my final note, pick this up with friends, it makes the experience a lot better, and it's a great group game.♥♥♥♥ birds.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiSuffers the same fate a lot of survival games do.Beyond the opening phase it's less of a struggle to survive and more of a grind. You're not really in any real danger, you're just repeating a farming routine to keep your food and water up. The shark is a nuisance but not a genuine danger, and the environment is about as threatening as a gold fish.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 17 Temmuz 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhat would I say... First of all, please, remember when you read this review that I AM WRITING THIS DURING THE EARLY ACCESS.Let's start with the good points. As far as survival games goes, Raft have a lot of good things to offer. Gameplay is quite good, and if you played a few survival game before, you won't need to learn a lot. Some resources may be a bit hard to find, but you'll be able to cross this bridge easily. On the graphic part, the game have a very distinct universe, and it's quite good to see. The music do remind a lot minecraft's one, and feel totally adapted to this kind of game, so that's a good point too.Unlike some of the biggest names of survival like Ark or 7 days to die, there is no manually painted map for you to explore. Every game is a new map, with new islands to discover. You also have strictly nothing to see on the sea to help you know where you are going, so you will do a lot of your travels praying luck to show you the way. It add a very deep and immersive feeling to the game : you have no idea of where you are, nor where you should go.This immersion is improved by the wonderful onceanographic engine of the game. You certainly feel the sea changing with the weather, and given that you will *always* be on your raft, that's great. Seriously, all that I was hoping for is there, and that's great.Finally, you can really create your very own modular ship - it's not some kind of pre-build thing like in some other game. That's also something great - survival game is a lot about crafting, and this is done here.But then, why doesn't I recommanded it ? Why, good question, you brilliant fellow ! Actually, there are a few little ""bad"" point in the game. Let's start with the ""Ok, this will probably stay and it's not a good news"" ones.The first bad thing is this stupid shark. The shark is always near you, and trying to eat you (like, you know, a shark). And when you're in the sea, well, that's great ! That's a great addition and it makes going under sea dangerous and all, and that's what we expect. But the shark have another function : once every so often, it goes and start eating your boat (seriously ?), and if you don't react fast enough, a little piece of your raft is gone. And that part is bad. First of all, it's annoying ; we're doing something else, and suddenly we have to rush to save our ship. It also require you to play with the sound on, as you have strictly no other way to know that the shark is attacking - being disabled, the sound is sometime a huge problem for me, especially since I cannot have the game sound and still hear my friends on Discord, so it's either the game or multiplayer. And the worst part is that after two or three time, you count and discover that even if you manage to turn away the shark, as long as you keep a 1-line passing by around your raft, it's actually the same price (not including plastic, but... that's too easy to get) to let the shark eat what it want and rebuild after that - and you don't have to stop everything and run.Another thing that did annoy me is a small thing, but it was really disappointing : it's fishing. I mean, it's a sea-themed game, there are fish everywhere, so fishing must be a huge part of it ? Answer : no. Don't take me wrong, fishing IS an important part of the game. Except it basically sum up to ""left click, wait, left click"". No mini-game, nothing. I used to read a book while waiting for fish to catch - especially since a very important object can only use 2 out of the maybe 5 ou 6 different fish of the game, for a reason that I currently ignore...But those two things would not mean ""no"" for this game, as it's quite small. Sure, I could add that there is a lot of farming involved, but let's be honest : in a survival game, there is ALWAYS a lot of farming involved - and that's the part I love the most.So, why did I say no ? Well, a very important part of any survival game is the amount of things you can do, and that's where Raft fall short. Please remember, I'm writing this DURING THE EARLY ACCESS, so it may have changed when you buy and test it - but as for now, it took me a few hours to learn how the game worked, then after mayber 5 or 6 hours in a new world I had learned every single recipe in the recipe book, and created them all. The list is short, and although there is a real use behind every single element, I feel that after 14h of playing, i've ""beat the game"".Sure, I didn't test multiplayer... the thing is, as it is, I don't feel like making my friends by the game. I do like to test early access - they doesn't. And right now, the game is way to empty to be more than what would have been a demo a few years back - a pretty good demo, mind me, but still a demo.Does this mean you shouldn't buy the game ? Well... it's up to you. If you like to test a game, to see it change, to see new things go in, then by all means, go for it. There is nothing really wrong with the game as it is, and it's fun to play. Just keep in mind that it's short-played, but that it will grow - and when it will, then you will be glad to have it. Now, if you want a game that you will play countless hours and that have a lot to discover... wait a bit. Come back in a few month, and it will be the perfect game for you.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 9 Kasım 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesi*sigh* This game is cool and is pretty neat but it is way overpriced and unless your really bad you will ""complete"" the game within a few hours. 20$ is not worth 5 hours and I got bored after my 5 hours of playing.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Mart 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiIntriguing at first, but becomes boring very quickly.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiGenerally speaking, the game is fun, there's lots to do, and if you like craft/survival/build games then this will pique your interest; however, if you're going to commit time to this game, you should know a few things.First and foremost, the save system is broken.  If you think you can just restore an old save when something goes wrong (either at your hand or when the game bugs out), you cannot.  The game offers the option to load one of several backup copies but this feature does not work properly.Second, when you die there is no dropped backpack or any way to reclaim your items.  This is compounded by a below average combat mechanism which means the likelihood of this happening is high.Third, the water and food consumption rate is ridiculously high.  You spend an abnormally high amount of time managing food and water.  This is not mitigated by improving character statistics as you progress either because there is no RPG element at all.Lastly, there is no dev console or cheat commands to compensate for any of the games' shortcomings.  If the game bugs...all the hours you put into that world are for not.  If you make a mistake, you'll likely be faced with the decision ""Do I grind all over again to get all my important items back or do I write off the time I've put in so far and walk away from the game?"".I've chosen the latter.  Maybe I'll check back on the game in another six months to see if the devs have addressed these serious game breaking issues and give it another try.For anyone who hasn't tried this game yet but is interested, you'll enjoy the experience right up to the point when one of the scenarios above comes into play...so, just go in knowing this and hopefully this will prevent you from rage throwing your computer out the window.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 28 Haziran 2022More of an ""eh"" than a ""No"".Really meant for multiplayer.  Singleplayer just has a lot of busy work and an early game curve that kinda sucks.Many of the early threatening animals are just a bit too irritating to deal with.  Boars and Birds can easily kill you when all you have is a pointy stick.  Not a problem in an of itself, but when dying means that you instantly lose 2/3rds of your (again, in the early game) scarce inventory.  It's not dropped, so if you can brave whatever killed you it's possible to reclaim it. Just gone.In multiplayer you can rescue each other, but that's no help to the solo player.  I can't comment on the mid game, as I haven't seen much of it since the 1.0 release.I played it earlier in development and found the busywork a little grating, not to mention the initial process of feeding and watering yourself quite tight — but I thought that these might be smoothed a little in the main release.  Nope.  That's' just how things are meant to be.None of the above are complete dealbreakers. However, the fact of the matter is that you spend so much of your time doing very dull things just to keep your head above water (har har) that after the third or so death I had to ask myself ""do I actually *want* to respawn and do this all again?As it turns out, no.  No I didn't.It's quite probable that as a multiplayer game, this is lessened and fun.  Unfortunately as I've had a very so-so experience, I don't feel able to recommend it to friends in order to find out.Addendum:I have since played Raft with a friend and, yep, it's a lot more fun with friends.The busy work is cut in half and because you can focus your efforts the extra mouths to feed/water are no concern at all.  What's more, because you are spending your time chatting away with each other — plotting on what to do next, etc — you don't notice how much busywork you are doing.I still stand by my review for singleplayers, but I feel able to say that it's worth it in multiplayer, as long as you aren't looking for high octane gaming or mind doing repetitive tasks.  Because, boy, you still do a lot of that.I'm not going to change the ""verdict"" of the review, as I think the singleplayer viewpoint is probably underrepresented in the reviews at large.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Haziran 2022I started playing Raft in 2020. Right before the Taronga chapter came out and adored it. The aesthetic, the world building, and the fact that the story being hinted at was generally a really interesting one. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with the final chapter. Both of the new story islands felt smaller than everything that had come before them, with less exploration and less world building. Not to mention the changes they made to what story they had. Everything just felt so rushed, like they were trying to get me to the end of the game as soon as possible.Not to mention the sudden addition of platforming and boss fights, both of which were done rather poorly, especially given how clunky combat is, which is a lot easier to overlook for most of the game because he enemies aren't as big of a deal.The addition of the trading posts makes no sense. And only one of the blueprints they sell actually has any benefit other than aesthetic.Also? what am i supposed to do once i beat the game? Does it basically become a sand box to run around in? Does Utopia still need anything? The finale just felt so lacklusterAll in all, it really suck to watch a game i really enjoyed be basically ruined by a shoehorned ending.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Haziran 2022Game is pretty meh, It feels like a bare-bones version of the forest. If you like exploration and intense situations this game is not for you. If you like spending 15 minutes while waiting to drift to an island for some sand then consider this game. It gets more fun with friends but still felt like it lacked the initial motivation to play. Building can be a little fun but resource collection is extremely boring as you just wait and throw a hook at each individual copy pasted log that drifts by and eventually get a couple of nets set up so you can afk waiting for the same 6 islands to gather some required items for the story.tl;dr The game feels boring, has a lackluster story, and the gameplay does not make up for it. Does not feel high quality in any way.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 8 Temmuz 2022i have super mixed feelings on this game, it  could honestly be great but the things holding it back REALLY hold it backill just list some pros and conscons- the shark feels like a place holder, it serves no purpose than to just annoy the player, and poses no actual challenge- this game is ridiculously grindly, and has some of the worst loot for bigger islands- the ai is dumb, ai see play, ai charge at player, ai repeat- the big story islands suck, the arent fun to explore and have bad loot for the effort you put inpros- pretty graphics- customizing your raft is the best part of the game- theres a great concept here, it just needs some polish",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 NisanI personally quite liked this game. Why am I giving it a negative review? Because I feel like it could've done a lot better.We'll start with the positives:I really liked the art style. It fits the game, and it's easy on the eyes.The raft building is solid. It's resource hungry and grindy, sure, but you can end up with a really fun and practical, nice looking raft, and it feels good.Very fun co-op aspects of the gameplay, great with friends.And now the negatives:Severe lack of QoL features. For an example, there's no crafting from nearby storage (although you can fix this with a mod).EXTREMELY grindy and time consuming. Now I'm lucky enough to not have a lot going on in my life right now, and the grinding isn't as braindead as a lot of games, but do NOT pick up this game expecting to speed through it. Your equipment frequently breaks, you can't repair it and must craft new ones. The shark will take chunks out of your raft, which you must rebuild. (You can stop this by reinforcing the outer foundations, but this costs a LOT of metal and is grindy in itself. Gotta love having to grind to prevent other grinding)Food and water constantly weigh you down. Running the raft is quite a task- you'll have to keep the crops watered, growing, and the gulls scared away from them, you've got to harvest resources from your nets periodically, you've got to keep your food cooking, your purifiers purifying, the shark with their teeth not sunk into your precious raft foundations, etc. Progress is frustratingly slow at times.Now, you CAN unlock things to prevent all this. Advanced scarecrows to keep seagulls off your crops permanently, and sprinklers connected to your automatic purifiers for free water and automatic purifying- all you've got to do is replace the batteries every once in a while. Pipe fed engines and an automatic biofuel refiner to fill your tank. As I said before, reinforce the foundations to keep the shark off them. Get better versions of tools to make them more efficient and durable.But almost all of these are locked behind story progress. Heck, you don't even get the third tier of tools until you complete the storyline entirely. An anchor that you don't have to drop manually and can instead operate from your engine controls? Locked behind completing the second-to-last story island- meaning you'll only ever use it to dock at the last island. Electric grill to prevent grinding for planks just to eat? Also locked behind the third-to-last island.This is the part of the game I hate the most. It's grindy as all hell, and the only way to make it less painful is to do more of the story and unlock better stuff. Good survival games have a story for those who want it. In Raft, you've got to do the story to progress in any way, and that's the part I most dislike. Want a backpack upgrade? It's in the final story island, so have fun using that to carry the loot from the final boss back home.The only conclusion I can draw from this is that the game expects you to keep playing after you complete the story. But why would you? At that point you're just improving your raft for the sake of improving your raft. Yeah, you can make a titanium sword now, but there's nothing new to kill with it. Maybe that's how some people like to play it, but as for me, I just lose all motivation to play on a save after completing the story, leading me to most likely never craft these endgame tools. It's such an odd design choice. Why can't all these upgrades and stuff be available before you do any of the story?TL:DR Grind is enjoyable enough, but the fact that the majority of the game is grind probably kills the game for a lot of people.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiAt this point I along with 2 family members have given this game a good 5 1/2 hours of play time, even though we wanted to quit within 2. I wanted to give it time to explore all the options later on in game and we also played at Normal level. I will say, I loved the concept and even appreciate the idea and believe if they continue balancing the game it could be amazing. but once again I feel stuck with a game where it is all about eating. you eat a potato and your starving again in minutes, I took count, you need to eat 22 potatoes & beets a day cycle for 1 person or you DIE!  and funny thing is a human being in the real world can go 3 days without food, and even in drastic conditions a couple potatoes a day or even 2 fish should sustain someone, their water consumption might be tough but more on point than the food option. Sharks are cool but the weapons cost you spend to defend is a waste as the weapons do nothing to the shark, so don't bother. it is cheaper to let the shark eat a section of raft and rebuild it. if your storage is full and you don't realize it, you will toss your recently crafted item into the ocean for the sharks. I never played the free demo, but was really anticipating a fun building & crafting game similar to 7 days to die, but on the water. And it fell way short of that. It is so completely repetitive that it actually made me bored. if all you want to do is fish, grab items, rebuild raft, eat and drink. that is your life in Raft. when you play alone it is a bit more tricky as you have to try and do everything all at once and you will run out of raft pieces before you get very stable. When you die you lose everything including your hook and have half or less of life, food and water. Which leads to you dying even quicker the next time. At this point I am not sure I will give it much time in the future, until it has been improved. definitely needs work and debugging. So I do not recommend it at this time.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 19 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe hunger and thirst system is just ridiculous and needs an overhaul. You can catch and eat a massive fish which will keep you fed for about 5 minutes before you need to eat again. It's hard to focus on anything when you're constantly having to worry about your hunger and thirst. It's not like other survival games where you drink and eat and you don't need to worry about it for maybe another 20-30 mins.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 25 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiA really good game tbh, then why don't I recommend it?Well they've made a game that they can expand indefinitely, however, they are a very small team, which now starts to show.People want updates, heck even my friends thought this was gonna be updated on a weekly basis, sadly that's not the reality, in 6 months we've seen a small bugfix patch.once you and your friends have completed chapter 2, then what?, the game leaves you hanging in this vast ocean and without any sense of purpose once you've completed as of today ""The second chapter""I'd still play this game if updates were to come out, but if they really want this game to become something, they have to go from ""hobby"" to ""business"" and get some more programmers working on this.

"Yayınlanma: 27 Ocak 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiUnfortunately, I cannot with good conscience recommend this game at this stage in its development.PROS:++ Graphics are beautiful, save for some animation and clipping issues, and the music is great, despite not being played very often.++ The first moments of scavenging for items feel very appropriate for this game and set a fitting mood.++ The possibility of finding recipes and experimenting with food crafting and different cooking stations adds a nice depth and immersion, should you want to expand on your chef qualities or roleplays.+ Seeing islands slowly show up in the horizon adds a very Wind Waker-esque feeling.CONS:--- An extreme lack of content.--- The game ends up being as empty and barren as the vast ocean it's taking place on.-- Mere hours into the game, every task and event ends up being repetitive, from the shark attacks to the cooking and smelting of resources.- Actually approaching and exploring islands is very limited and disappointing.Overall: 3,5/10 - Potential in the future, but the present is barren and lacking.Playing this game with friends is absolutely the best way to experience this game, but even so, the game is so severely limited and empty that it gets repetitive and boring within hours. It has the feel of an open world exploration game, but ends up being strictly a resource management game, which can feel frustrating in the beginning, but quickly ends up a task too easy to handle. With a raft filled with chests with every possible resource imaginable, there's nothing left for the game to provide, with no actually interesting events or enemies. Everything you see in the game feels like a new discovery, like something you'll enjoy exploring, but actually approaching them up close gives nothing but a deep disappointment.At the end of the day, the most exciting parts of the game are building the raft - a task which ends up being very frustrating because of frequent shark attacks - and recipe experimentation - if you enjoy cooking in games, for whatever reason, be that roleplaying or just to discover and exhaust possibilities. The endless stream of debris and the surreal nature of the shark often took me out of any immersion I had found myself in, and for presenting itself in-game as an open world exploration game, it never rewards exploration and for any actual progress, the game forces you in specific directions. There's no open world or exploration in this game, at least none that feels exciting or rewarding.The game is currently way too empty to be thoroughly enjoyed, despite having an interesting idea and nice potential in theory.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Nisan 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI am very divided about this game. If I could give it a neutral rating I would, but frankly I steer more towards a negative review if we're talking about full price. As of the time of writing this review, I have logged around 6 hours, but it honestly felt like 20.It's fun to play with friends, but only because it's your friends. The game itself does not provide much of the fun, unfortunately.Raft is an extremely interesting take on the survival/crafting genre where your base is constantly floating along the vast ocean. It's a great idea, but unfortunately some minor technical details truly ruin the whole experience.First off, the damn planks. You need planks for literally everything: building your base, crafting most things plus cooking and boiling water. So every single mechanic of the game is tied to planks, which you find randomly floating in the ocean and can occasionally cut from trees. You usually get them one or maybe three at a time, if you're lucky.The problem is that you get so few compared to what you need that you end up running out and not finding any for tens of minutes at a time. Currently I have around 80 plastic, leaves and similar items (which are still very useful in the early game) but zero planks, as I'm constantly using them all up as soon as I find any. They're the only resource that you need to keep burning to get food and water as well as keep crafting breakable items. It's truly frustrating to have to tunnel vision on a single resource (that you get randomly). This is easy to fix as it's just tied to the drop rate and quantity you find.Apart from that, the shark AI is truly laughable. Not only do they teleport from huge distances as soon as you jump in the water, but they respawn after around 5 minutes if you manage to actually kill them (which is not easy). Oh yeah, and they munch on your base every few minutes, and the only way to stop them is to poke them with a wooden spear (which needs a huge number of planks and breaks quite easily).I understand that the game needs some challenges, but having a godlike shark permanently circling around you is neither realistic nor fun, just annoying.Raft does have a vast amount of stuff to craft, but the progress feels extremely slow. 6 hours in, all we've managed to craft is a basic base with food, water, plants and a smelter along with a few decorative and support items. All the islands we came across were pretty much the same, not really that interesting or unique.The audio is passable but extremely repetitive. Every action produces the same exact sound effect, and if you find a radio it plays the same one or two songs over and over. The graphics are alright, but the animations feel very janky and static.Most of the positive stuff I can say about this game is related to ""role-playing"", you being stranded on a raft in the open sea...it's pretty atmospheric when everything works. There's also a sense of duty, to not give up and keep surviving despite having to do the same repetitive chores day in and day out. Some people might even enjoy that. But as of right now, I cannot recommend this game for the full price. I will update this review if anything changes.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Aralık 2022TLDR: Play it with friends and don't take the story seriously and it's a perfectly passable game with a charming aesthetic and fun decorations.As far as survival crafting games go, the core mechanics aren't bad and can be rather fun especially with friends.However, after finishing the story and exploring the majority of the upgrades available for the raft the game became very trivial. None of the combat was challenging, the survival aspect was near gone because of how easy it is to make a completely self sufficient raft and as much as I wanted to love this game with all of its charm, I can't say I do.Without getting into too much detail or potential spoiler territory, by the time I got to the final story based island I felt like I was finishing things out of obligation, a chore I had to do rather than for enjoyment and with the time I had sunk into the game I didn't want to just give up at the end. I had to see it through.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Haziran 2022Take this no with a grain of salt. This game has a lot to offer and is generally enjoyable. Unfortunately the 1.0 release is nowhere near a full and complete game. In fact I would argue that the 1.0 release is WORSE than the early access. Shark teleports all over the place, objects glitch and fly, inventory management is still abysmal, the UI in general is just awful, and the ""hard mode"" is not actually hard... instead this game fell into the ""more hp baddies = hard"" trap. Some have complained about food and water in hard (understandable) but personally I hate more HP baddies. This does not change any actual difficulty; instead, this just makes the game more annoying. To make a game hard, one should add challenging factors, like say... fall damage? This would force the player to rethink how they originally played or built. making baddies have more hp means you stab more. Nothing actually changes.I was really hoping to give this a solid thumbs up, but what we have here is someone who got bored over a year ago, got tired of reading suggestions, slapped the rest together and called it quits.Maybe wait for a sale or something.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 Ocak 20222022.7 Last edit:The story is updated to the end, and... I think the ending is really lame. Classic antagonist, classic boss scene, classic ending scene, nothing really special or new. I always liked the earlier storytelling where you are the one exploring and putting every clue together, but the ending just falls back to a really mediocre story. One big big bad bad guy trying to change the world, and stopped ""just in time"" by our heroes who spent most of the time floating a raft on a sea in an apocalyptic world. Bravo, bravo.New content update is also similar to the plot, good concept in the beginning but lame execution in late game updates. New non-cosmetic items require titanium everything, and do not do anything new apart from fulfilling the current job in a posh way. You like the grill using wood to burn? Good, take this electric-heating grill with batteries and larger capacity. Additional functions? Don't think about it. Plus, titanium can only be acquired through RNG mining, and you need to find many unexplored islands using a crap radar for that. So in conclusion, useless fancy things that can be totally ignored.Overall, the updates of this game reflects many similar indie games. Starting out with a cool concept, but gradually lost inspiration and direction when making it. It is lucky to see the 1.0 update of Raft, but I cannot say the long wait is worth it at all. The game is very likely reaching the end of major updates, so I maintain my stance that don't buy it if you seek long hours from it.Original review:TLDR: Don't buy it if you expect repeated runs for survival challenges; main motivations for playing this will be its story, which haven't been updated for more than a year.Game is really fun for the first few 30 ish hours with friends, you will travel to different places to do main quests, see different islands with art styles and build new techs for your little raft.However, when the main questline is finished there isn't much to do. All you did is trying to expand your raft to survive so that you can explore the lore behind, but when you finished there isn't much challenge in terms of survival element and your raft lost direction to sail anywhere.The devs are also rather slow on the updates. The last update about the quests is on Oct, 2020, which is a year and two months from now, and the next chapter is still nowhere to be seen. As a result, I would not recommend it if you want to grind out the survival element of it (because late game survival is brainless and boring). If you just want to have a few hours of fun with friends and move on, it is a good choice.Leaving this a negative here just until the devs update the next chapter.Edit:People are mad at me because I leave a negative for a cheap early access game with 30 hours on record. Okay so here it goes:1. I really want to leave a neutral here but there is no such thing on Steam. I ended up leave a negative so that people may see its flaws instead of seeing all the good sides of it.2. Not many survival games are expensive. Consider Forest, Project Zomboid, The Long Dark, etc. You can easily get more hours from those for a similar price. Also, in my 30 hours I am always the host of the game so I go AFK a lot of the time and let my friends do the exploring.3. Early access nowadays does not really mean anything, as anyone can easily slap an EA tag on the game and leave it in EA for years. Plus, I said in my review that I do not recommend it to players seeking to grind the survival element of it. It does not affect if you just want to buy it and have a few hours of fun.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 22 Eylül 2022Look this game is alright, but there are some serious issues this game has.The good:- Designing rafts in this game is amazing, I could spend all day designing boats or houses in this game....and thats it. I mean while you are progressing through the story its fun but by the time you reach the 5th story location its issues really start to become noticeable.The cons:- serious repetitiveness, the combat, how fast hunger/thirst goes down, the material collection, the exploration, is all just so repetitive. The combat is the worst offender, because the weapons work terribly and birds are hard to hit.- as mentioned previously, the material collection and exploration. once you see all the islands you begin to memorize every island and exploration is completely mundane. Material collection is just so boring since theres no interesting way to get materials like adventures, its just chop trees or spend 20 minutes scraping the seafloor on one of the 10 preset islands.- The shark, probably the worst mechanic in any game I have ever played (and thats saying alot being a player of World of Warships with their CV mechanics). Its artificial difficulty. Its doesn't even make the game hard, its just a nuisance and makes gathering materials more miserable and longer than it already is.- Optimization, I dont know if its just me or putting this game at anything above 60 fps turns my pc into a furnace, and I have a well cooled and powerful pc.The game is very fun when you are designing rafts or doing story islands, but once you beat the story, there's no point in playing anymore, all of the best stuff is at the end, when its all useless. Subsequent playthroughs aren't even exciting because you know everything and you realize how mundane and tedious the game is. Its a good concept with great potential but seriously needs work on the longevity of the game outside of designing things as well as the tedium and worldbuilding.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 30 OcakI was pretty ""hooked"" when the game first came out in early access, and the early island hopping was fun. The first locations they added were pretty solid, except I did distinctly dislike that you cannot harvest any of the non-palm or mango trees on islands, except for some reason the cute decorative trees in one of the later story locations. Like c'mon, it's an entire forested island, surely I can chop down *one* pine tree!Which as far as story goes, it's somewhat lackluster. I collected every note at every location (save possibly the final one, because at that point I was just content to finish the game without it crashing again) and despite some intrigue into the people involved, it's very easy to get lost in the notes and some make very little sense. The characters you ""meet"" and take with you (skin unlocks) are conspicuously absent in the notes as well, where you will find a living, breathing person in a building with story related notes, but none of the people are related to the notes. The only time you interact directly with story characters is after the game is already over.Which is where I come to progression. Titanium, in and of itself, is a very strange addition and only exists to pad out how long the game takes. The only way to ""naturally"" obtain it is by using metal detectors to find buried briefcases full of the stuff (Why? What is the explanation for that? What businessman lost his luggage of titanium ore??)Almost all the uses are silly, like the fact that an advanced grill takes titanium to build. Ah well, you say, titanium tools and weapons exist and they're the best in the game!Except you get them after the game is already over. The rate at which you learn technologies always felt like it was an island or two behind when you really needed them. I never built any of the things found in the Chapter 3 islands before the end of the game. And while you can build an advanced headlamp, you cannot build, say, an advanced air tank, which would have been useful when the game drops you into an underwater boss fight against the pickiest, finickiest, most useless AI.Hit detection on enemies is also abysmal. To hit a polar bear with any weapon I had to stand inside it, and the number of times I was unable to loot a corpse because the ragdoll physics made the interactable hitbox move underground was obnoxious.And as previously mentioned, in trying to play through the story with my friend, it started crashing nearly nonstop after we reached the second to last island. We would get about 20 minutes between CTDs. Half the time when loading into the world, the second player would spawn under the map and have to just sit and wait for the ""unstuck"" button to appear on the menu.All in all, I rate the general exploration and experience pretty well.The story is alright, but I feel like the boss fights (of which there are at least 4) are unnecessary and drag the enjoyment way down. Might be better if the jank inherent to the running, swimming, and combat system weren't so pronounced. Also, please stop putting parkour into games with clunky movement controls. Even after 35 hours in the game, jumping never feels ""good."" 2/5, with the biggest positive being most of the exploreable locations.Definitely worth playing, if you only want the raft-building aspect or to play with friends and don't expect the story to be compelling. If you find yourself compelled by the story, I feel the ending is a bit of a let down. I was pretty onboard, even if the actual plot is somewhat spotty. I still have very little idea what the villain's motivation was other than ""poor people bad, putting me in charge good.""Will I play it again? Probably.Will I play the *story* again? Probably not.If all you want is a watery sandbox to play around in, go wild. It's good for that, if you can get over the jank and the bugs. The actual raftbuilding is solid. I would likely wait for a sale.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 8 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThere's not much to say about to say this game. Good concept but the execution so far is nothing amazing. You have a vast ocean that's filled with little to nothing, above and below the water. You gather resources to build up your raft. All in all your playthrough of this game is finished in 6 - 8 hours. I don't want to spoil the end game for you but yeah it's lacklustre. I wasn't moved. I understand it's early access but there's simply no content here yet to justify the price.

"Yayınlanma: 23 Şubat 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesifun game, but one of the worst update schedules I've even seen for an ""Early Access Game"". The expectations are set by the price, not the size of the team, they absolutely owe it to the players to invest in the team. games like astroneer, grounded, craftopia, and other similarly priced games have released so much content in the time since raft's last major update. In two years all they can release is pretty walls and still call their game 'early access' is a big dump on the players.chapter 3 amendment tldr: All the new content is on the islands, thought this was a game about rafting? Plus the titanium grind is the worst way I've seen collecting a material in a video game, its long, RNG, tedious and all for tiny amounts compared to what you need. Plus you've basically completed the game at the point you get all titanium recipes. Need to see titanium gathering changed, as well as preferred if chapter 3 included literally any new raft feature that isn't just an upgraded tool or component.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 22 Ağustos 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis is one of those times where I wish Steam had a ""Not Now"" option for these reviews. So this review will get a red mark from me in it's place.On concept alone this game makes sense. Stuck on raft.....survive. The survival game market doesn't need much in terms of a complex setting to get the concept across. However, this does create a very awkward conversation when you compare this to another well known, ocean themed survival game called Subnautica; hence my initial mention of wanting a ""Not Now"" button. Because I feel you shouldn't buy this right now. It doesn't have the content available to compete even with the closest comparison, let alone others in the genre.Got myself a fair share of complaints as well. Like how most of the first tier equipment tools degrade too fast for the amount of resources gone into them. Great example is the fishing pole. You need quite a lot of rope (eight pieces in fact) to craft one pole. My first time playing this game was in a group of three people and we couldn't manage to gather that much rope to keep fishing for food a constant thing. In fact my whole time of sailing left me without a pole 2/3 of the time. So if in a three man stack we can't even keep one person fishing for food all the time, what is a solo person suppose to do?This kind of leans into my next complaint as well. As much as I gave props to the concept of surviving on a raft, those points are lost when you realize that the early game gathering and surviving experience is not good at all. Resources are drip fed to you and you can miss even getting them. You start with a rope hook, that may or may not be mechanically broken upon spawn in, and must use it to fish out materials floating by. This is not a good design for survival game gathering in my eyes. On top of the lack of tutorial, gathering materials feels sluggish and tedious. Almost like you are doing it simply because that's what you do in these types of games. Gathering materials in the early game needs to feel like a Black Friday 100% off sale; trying you damnedest to gather everything because it all matters to you before you even know why. Here, you are simply regulated to what the game drips feeds you, and again you can miss this stuff.But some of you might question why I would say that you can miss materials floating by in the ocean. Just swim and get them, right? Well complaint number three comes in the form of a shark named Bruce. Is that his canon name or fan name I will never know but here he is. At the very start of the game. Why, may I ask, did you put a killer threat at the very beginning of you survival game when the players don't even have proper items to defend themselves yet. Players need a chance to learn the rules and mechanics of the area they are in. Minecraft doesn't send enemies at the player till they hit night time. Subnautica spawns the player in an area that is devoid of hostile life roaming around. Here you have a minute before this shark swirls around you for the rest of the game. Yes he can die but he respawns and at the beginning you don't have the tools needed to do so.I have other minor things, like the fact that we can mine sand with our rope hook but digging up patches of dirt is a no go, but all of those are personal digs at things I don't quite care for. At the end of the day, I would enjoy this game more if it was better made. I understand that these guys are working on this on their spare time and that this is still EA on steam, but it's been out for three years now and I would of expected a more streamlined and polished opening experience by now. So for now, wait on this game and hope for improvements down the line.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 31 Ağustos 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft is a survival game where you gather resources from the sea and from various islands you encounter, to build a raft to explore the world.The main qualities of the game are:- the early game, where every broken raft and island you encounter is a treat and instills a sense of wonder, and where you are gathering just enough resources to afford some tool or another square to your raft- The music- the fact that you can play with multiple people on your raft.Especially that last part helped me get through this game.Unfortunately the amount of content is on the low side, even after 2+ years of Early Access. The story consists of 5 ""story"" islands with story elements that only losely tie together. After the initial rush to get food and water going, the game turns into a giant resource grind, where you go through entire chests of wood at a time, and have to visit a LOT of islands to get enough metal to finally stop the shark eating your raft every single waking moment. Achievements are lackluster and mostly just statistics for the devs I feel. Since Update 12: The Second Chapter (October 2020) there is a bit of automation you can focus on, but not nearly as much as I would want. Since Update 13: The Renovation Update (June 2021) there is an adequate amount of customisation, with a reasonable amount of furniture and decoration options. The story still makes very little sense.Overall, I think the game is light on content, even after 2 years of Early Access. I have a lot of time in this game, mainly because I use it to hang out with coworkers. The game has little more than a day or two of actual gameplay in it if you focus on the story and progression. If you are willing to grind out achievements and build the most over-the-top raft you can manage, you can spend a lot more time in this game. If you like survival games, I recommend buying it on sale. If you intend to get all achievements, be prepared to grind for hundreds of hours, visiting the same type of island over and over, killing the same 4 types of enemies over and over.Note: Updated this review in September 2021 to reflect the added content in Update 13.

"Yayınlanma: 9 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game could have been so much more.  Yet the lack of gameplay depth has really held this game back.The stats that you have to manage are no more than a chore once you have unlocked mediocre tech after a couple of hours of playing.The shark is just another annoying meaningless threat that the players have to deal with.There is no periodic event like huge waves or flashstorms that makes you become active in your decision making.  Everything is just easy to manage and bland, like an AFK game.And I believe the devs are aware of the lack of gameplay depth by making questionable design choices.Like the scarecrow, it doesn't scare off the seagulls but act as a temporary target for them to attack so that you'll have to constantly rebuild them; which adds another pointless thing that the player has to keep tabs on but brings no gameplay value.Another thing that pisses me off is that how the save files are written.  I have been playing multiplayer on hard and when in the case where all players die, loading a previous save file means nothing for the characters - it simply rolls back any changes done to your raft but the players will stay dead on the server having no way to revive themselves without tinkering with the save files with hex editors.I guess what I'm trying to say is that the point of interests are really fun to explore, but the journey there (80% of the game) is no more interesting than watching paint dry.",N/A

It feels like a Theme-park MMORPG where your progression is locked behind, for me, very boring back and forth running on islands or objects. Still not very 1.0 to me.On the other hand: If you like a Puzzle Game with Story with a survival on sea aspect, this may be for you.The most infuriating thing to me are the story islands. There is so much freaking backtracking and generally the design is unrealistic at best, which is fine as not everything have to make sense or be realistic, but some things really make no sense that I cant put fantasy ontop of it to excuse it (like, why have a building start with 4 pillars, then 2 and then a HUGE FREAKING pillar in the middle of the room... all with 40cm of concrete floors?)Now with 1.0 they added Voice-acting which quality ranges enormously. Especially why, when i ""read"" a note, are sounds playing too? To me kinda immersion breaking. And different Characters to play which essentially are skins which isnt too bad, just how they are introduced are weird to me.Kill the shark and its back in a moment. Youre hungry and thirsty from doing nothing so quick, you cant even go AFK while on an island, really had to pick up my dying partner all the way through a maze and stuff just to put her into a bed and then restock myself. Youre starving on ressources and then you swim in it. Its a very stark contrast that makes the endgame rather boring.Id still wish to be able to just play without the story, that for me is very badly made. When I picked this up, I signed up for a survival game on sea, not a Puzzle Story game with basic combat, buggy network and survival on sea.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Ocak 2019Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiThis game becomes repetitive after about an hour or so of gameplay. Considering all you can do is build a raft and be ""scared"" of a shark that shows up every few minutes just to eat a part of your raft, there is no reason for this game to cost twenty dollars. If it were was more to do I would justify the price, but the gameplay is still very barebones. Wait until it is out of early access before considering to purchase it, it just needs more time.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Temmuz 2022I can not recommend this game. The core gameplay is repetetive and grindy, the art is lackluster at best and the story and voiceacting is horrendous. The way you are forced to progress the story is very ""gamey"" and you don¨t care about the characters or the story they are trying to convey. After getting to the third island me and my buddy quit, after about 17 hours of playtime. Even though its a small indie studio that made this game, I can not recommend it because of the lack of modern features, graphics, yanky combat and overall underwhelming features. I could understand some of the lack of features and finish if it still was in early access, but this game was just fully released - and thats just sloppy work.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Mayıs 2018Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiI think this would be an ok game, but it bugs out too much. I played for a total of 55 minutes and twice during that time everything in the game (except my character and the ocean) suddenly disappeared. My raft was gone, the islands nearby, all the stuff floating in the water...everything...all gone. So I was left treading water in the ocean with all my progress wiped and no way to start over since everything was gone.If this happened twice in under an hour, forcing me to restart both times, I don't see how I can progress in the game.Plus, t he shark is unbelievably annoying.Submitted refund request.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 Eylül 2020I really enjoyed this game, right up until Balboa. This game isn't made for combat but you have to defend yourself on the big islands. The biggest problem is how expensive combat is. You constantly need planks, arrows bows and spears eat up your wood and when you die you don't drop resources they're just gone. Enemies have ridiculous amount of hit points so all you can do is shoot them from a distance or jump on top of a rock every time you get attacked. Combat not being fun wouldn't matter so much if it wasn't so punishing. I have no tools left, no resources and it feels like I might as well start over.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiFirst of the positives:-concept. It is cool. The idea of floating around and collecting resources to build up your moving castle is fun. You want to explore and see where the sea takes you-Graphics. It's very pleasant and functional. Well built up raft looks very cute. Animations aren't amazing but I don't see it as a big issue-Music. It goes well with the theme-Co-op survival game play which actually works! You do have to work together and the need to return to the same base(raft) is very neat and it is probably the biggest strength of the gameNegatives:-Oh boy this game DOES NOT respect your time and not in a good way. The game is grindy very very grindy-Wood is often the most limiting factor. There is never enough of it and virtually everything requires it from tools crafting to more advanced objects. I do not think there is enough trees in the amazon forest to build and maintain your base in Raft.-Inventory system is just outright abysmal, clunky and annoying. No auto sort... if you inventory is full you drop items without realizing it. The amount of storage and individual item stacks are inadequate... after just few hours of game play your raft will resemble Mearsk cargo ship with boxes everywhere to try and store all other stuff you find that you don't need that often. Except wood because there is never enough of it.-Crafting... again its just tedious. Building things is awkward and takes time, something you don't have on higher difficulty as your character needs to consume stupid amount of water and food all the time. With the amount of food consumed your character should die from overeating. If the game tries to be ""realistic"" you should be able to go without food for quite a few days at least.-The survival bit... Well this issue is not specific to RAFT itself but essentially the constant need to fill up your food and drink bars which drop down waaay too quickly is just frustrating. It is not hard just simply frustrating after doing it for few hours you feel like you will need a strong drink in real life as you essentially just worked in a virtual burger king except nobody actually is getting you any money for it. The game is not hard the primary surviving system isn't hard just tedious as F..k.-Shark... seriously I don't know what sort of sadistic people the devs are but the shark is one of the most annoying parts of the game. It NEVER leaves (even if you kill it another one will spawn after a minute). Lures are just a joke. It constantly eats your raft forcing you to waste your precious wood on repairs. It attacks you in the water the second you are in and after few hours its more annoying than scary. I think there is a real missed opportunity here as it could be more of a nemesis creature occasionally popping in and hunting you down so you need to be ready for it. The one every 30s or so attack in the water and every 10 min or so of your raft is just crap.-Most of your tools break and there is no way to fix them... you have to replace them. It's actually annoying enough that using better tools almost makes no sense as they use up too much of your other resources which take too much time to collect. Also certain stuff like flippers just should not degrade as quickly it's just silly and again more annoying than anything else-Raft actually feels like it's ocean is very shallow. Although exploration is one of the more fun parts you quickly realise most small islands are just carbon copies of each other with few trees, some fruit/flowers and metal ore/scrap to collect from the shallows.I will continue to play it for the fairly fun co-op and a vain hope that more interesting content/quality of life improvements will be added.I really wanted to like this game but sadly like most survival games its incessant grinding is just too much. This is further compounded by just a bunch of incredibly annoying mechanics that make the whole process feel like tedious dead end job...",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 20 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft - what will you become?So, if you are intrested in buying this game - please read some reviews, negative and positive. And to bring it to you in my review: No. This game is not worth 20 bucks. Absolutly not. Not at all. Not even close. Why you ask? Here is why:The graphics are okay, they are neither ugly nor beautiful. You could get more done using this art style, but hey, it is okay.The gameplay works okay and maybe even good, some things tend to bug (collision, oh boy) but the core works perfectly fineThe amount of things to do, build and research is a bad joke. Like a really, really bad joke. Like a ""your mum"" joke in 2030. In broken english. By a 45-year old. It is not just bad. It makes you uncomfortable and you just want to disappear from this world - it is that bad. You will be done in no time, even if you build and research [b[ EVERYTHING [/b] this game has to offer and build your raft to a really good state you would like to show your friends and be proud of it - you will be done in around6-7 hours.I am not joking, the amount of things this game has to offer is ridiculous. If it would be on sale for 5-10$/€/whatevermatchesthisamountofmoney you should buy it. That is cool. 20 bucks? You just got ripped off.The balancing is a thing to discussA LOTbut here is my opinion: It is not good in its current state, except you play with friends. But why? So, let me tell you. You tend to fish for things for an eternity. First to build your little, floating piece of junk, later to... well, extend your piece of better junk. And then you need to fish for food to. Because well, there is no better option at this point. If you would like to grow vegetables? Oh boy, these crop plots are expensive - fish for materials! And care for them, they need water and wanna be protected from seagulls! Okay, phew, got i - NO, you really should cook it! Because of you do not cook them, you will starve while eating them - they fill so little so slow - COOK THEM. Alright, geez, I will cook them. And waste my precious wood. And time. And space - well, that is unsatisfying.... so yeah, grab a fishing rod, cook them - and after 15 minutes you will haveSO MUCH FOOD - HELL YES. Literally so much, that if you really focus on fishing and grabbing barrels, that you are done for the next few hours. No joke. If you would try that with crops? Hahaha, good joke mate - get your lazy butt over here and start planting, watering and cooking them. For the rest of your Raft life.At this point you might say:""Hey. look at this idiot ranting an early access game, why do you play these games if you have no fun doing so!?""Well, because I love these genre. I love the art style. I love playing these games with my friends. And I have no problem buying Early Access Titles.And even if all of this sounded extremly negative to you - I had fun. Not as much as I expected, but I had fun. So why would I write so many bad things and not recommend it?Because it is an Axelot Game. If you are loving this game in its current state - oh boy. Wait for 1 year and you will hate it. Because it will not change. Not in the way it should. Not in the way you want or expect it.If you want to know what I mean, look at their previous game ""Scrap Mechanic"". It had the same art style and had a promising start too. But it went to a cash grab really fast. After a few months the meaningful updatesCOMPLETLYstopped. Yes. They added some things to build, some minor items, nothing really intresting or relevant. They just made it look like they would still work to improve their game. But no. They really did not. The survival mode which should come shortly after the release? Two and a half year later, nothing in sight. Not even a little bit. Not even a single implemented feature.And now back to Raft: I honestly think it will become this very soon too. They really have to prove their old fans wrong to get even the slightest bit of trust. And they really do not deserve any trust at all. Maybe they will really work longer than a half (hearted) year on this. Maybe they will not. Probably they will not. Most likely they will not.I know, it is hyped. It looks promising. It is Early Access, but PLEASE - for yourself - wait to buy it. For at least a few months. Because otherwise, you will find yourself, sitting on your Raft, done with all what this game has to offer - after 5-7 hours. Sad to not be able to refund it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiTook over a year to develop a copy-paste update. even for ONE PERSON this should not have taken over 3 months to make, let alone an entire team for a YEAR. the last update was on october 3rd of last year, and even that was a bad update. here's a list of stuff that's wrong with the game.-combat sucks, in general-all weapons do not do enough damage. it takes over 4 arrows to kill a cat-sized rat-arrows have rediculious drop, and bad hitboxes. not to mention they despawn in under 10 seconds.-animals eat so much damn grass, you require over 10 grass plots per animal if you intend to even explore the big islands without having one starve.-new electric pump has an oversized hitbox despite only having a small tube that could be shoved between the gaps in the floor-most of the new items require titanium, a horrible new resource that requires a metal detector and shovel to get. you can only get 1-2 for each island, and each craftable requires 4 or more.-the ""second chapter"" update made chests on most of the islands require the metal detector, making early game even harder and annoying to get metal and scrap.-the ""second chapter"" update slowed movement speed and reduced floating debris spawn rate, which makes engines horrible to use, as the alternative fuel to planks is now nearly impossible to get.-new islands in the ""seconds chapter"" update make spawning normal islands (where you get flowers) harder to get, reducing the amount of honey you can get from beehives by almost half. honey is required for making the alternative fuel for engines.-engines still use too much fuel in general, around 1 plank every 10 seconds. not a problem for 1, but considering that you need more for a larger raft, it makes it impossible to consistently use them past around 2-4.-seagulls STILL attack crop plots through walls and under flooring. this issue has been known for forever, this should have been fixed by now considering that every item from the hammer has been around for the same amount of time.-new food is just as good as the basic food at the end of the game, despite it requiring you to get to the 5th island.-there is an enemy every 5 feet on the new fifth island.-the screecher attack is still impossible to dodge.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 5 Ağustos 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiAfter a couple of solo starts, I played with some mates.After about 5 hours we had a huge raft with plenty of supplies coming in. We played a few evenings, mostly chatting and bobbing along.I say chatting, because as a host of a multiplayer game, my FPS was sat somewhere between 8 and 12. So moving, or doing anything was just not going to work.I have a fairly typical system; i7 3770k oc @ 4GHz, 6gb 1060 & 24 gb of ram. After googling the problem, there were a fair amount of folks with the same issue. I tried everything and couldn't resolve this.The development is painfully slow on this, with what I can only hope is placeholder textures and a complete lack of variation in gameplay as you bob along the seas. The islands are the same, nothing exciting happens and the story we were hoping for just never materialises.TLDR: Its a monotonous voyage into the blue, with cookie cutter islands and a woefully slow development cycle. In truth, the best experience is just sitting in the menu, at least that doesn't have FPS issues.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 3 Aralık 2022Had a good time playing with some friends over the past few months. Waited a long time for the dev team to finish the story line. After completing the game, I'm not impressed with anything they have done. The first few ""islands"" are pretty interesting and introduced some new mechanics, items, etc. The latter half of the game was a huge let down. It just became repetitive and the ""puzzles"" were too simple. The ending was the final blow. It was more of the same and the worst part was all of the new craftables that could have been used prior, were given to you when the game was already over!? The boss fight?? Horrible. The ending seemed so rushed, lazy and unnecessary. Was a lot of fun playing with some friends, but there are much better options in this genre.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 16 Aralık 2022honestly i enjoy this game as a survival base builder. i have played multiple times (twice to tangaroa, once to the end, multiple other worlds started). i’ve even been following some youtubers on their playthrough.but to be frank, the story isn’t all that compelling. for how many times i’ve played it and seen it, i can’t even begin to tell u the plot. i love my boy bruno but…that’s about it.when you get to the last three story island, things take a turn. there are multiple mechanics that are randomly introduced, multiple boss fights, puzzles, etc. it feels very disjointed from what the rest of the game has to offer. it teaches you mechanics in one area then it completely throws them out the next.now the final island. i love the design, it’s very cool and fascinating. the boss battle…i rushed through because the big bad was really annoying. i had no idea what he was going on about but i really wanted him to just shut up and let me do my thing.i have many unanswered questions. who are we? why are we the ones to solve everything? why do we get team members just as skins and not npcs to add and interact with on our boat? why does everyone else have voice acting but the MC? who are these new characters anyway? they aren’t even mentioned in any notes at all. they’re just…there.the ending was just overall underwhelming, disappointing, and disjointed.the shark also gets old very quickly in the endgame.i think the shark should’ve been the main villain. go toe to toe with that little nuisance and then he never bothers u again lolas a random side note, what is the point of getting titanium weapons and tools right after finishing the main story? i feel most would stop playing after the story is done (especially after it leaves a bad taste in your mouth). the titanium weapons would’ve been very helpful during any of the boss battles. i couldn’t even be excited about them because what is the point of them now?i recommend the game as a slow-paced survival base-builder. i do not recommend for any storyline. take your time with the game and you’ll enjoy it. i took my time going to every island in my path and still felt like i busted through the story too fast.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 4 Aralık 2022There will be spoilers in this post, so please keep that in mind. I can understand the appeal of raft. At first I really liked it and the goal was semi-clear. But raft is one of those games where you kind of have to look up what to do in order to figure out how to progress. Which is fine. My main reason for disliking this game is due to the food and thirst bar. If you do not have at least a full bottle of water or a stack of food at all times it feels like you are always returning to the raft just to grab something. It is especially visible during late game. You could not explore for more than ten minutes without having to return for food or water. Yes the bowls of soup and drinks are super useful, but unless if you are willing to farm for all the materials it doesn't seem worth it. A late section of the game requires you to explore underwater and there is a boss. Here is another spoiler warning. The goal is to lead the boss into pillars, advance to the next floor, then do that same process again and again. It works for other games, but not for this one. I kept running into a bug where the boss would either go through the pillar or keep rotating around it, only for it to immediately charge at me. I had to spend over 30 minutes fighting the boss and even then I still have not beaten it. Might just be a skill issue, but I don't think i've played a more agitating game than raft for a while.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 24 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI wasn't overly impressed with the game as a whole. It is a fun idea in theory but the execution could be far better than what it is. I know my CONS list is rather large but there is a lot of room for improvement in my opinion. The game has been around for a while and I don't feel much progress has been made overall to make the experience more engaging or fun to build upon. Overall, if you're looking for a survival game it can be fun to play for a little while but I think you'll eventually get bored/irritated. Maybe the game is better with friends but I've reached my maximum interest after just 20 hours.PROS:-Open world-Building-Some exploration/Story-Basic survival game with food/water-Crafting systemCONS:-Constant sea gull attack on your crops every time you turn your back-Constant shark attacks on your raft and no way to stop it. No spikes or anything. You just stab him every time. I eventually ignored him and just opted to repair my raft every ten minutes-Underwater game play is very bland, slow and you have nearly no breath. Plus you have to mine underwater rather than grab and go-If the shark eats your raft under an important item it will be destroyed-Controlling where your raft goes is a chore even with a motor and it can be frustrating-Stack size is 20 and with how much junk you collect it can get out of control really quick-Armor/breather/fins all have durability and I don't much like that. Most tools get used up extremely quick-The islands don't have much on them besides trees and scraps in the water. Wasn't very exciting to explore them.-There isn't any real way to tell what islands you've already visited or any marker locations-Water collection should be passive, not something I have to refill constantly-The shark, even if killed, spawns back in like three minutes so you never get any reprieve-The combat is very bland. You run in and stab then back up and then repeat.-The furnaces cook one item at a time and it can be frustrating micromanaging them if you have a lot of ore to get through-I had to play on easy because losing my entire inventory upon death was an absolute NOPE for a survival game-Did I mention how obnoxious the shark and sea gulls are?-By the time I found Llamas to get wool for armor I had basically completed the story and killed bears/boars/lurkers before even needing the armor. Same with the extra backpack space. I was at the end of the game before I got the extra five slots.I think a lot of items could be added to improve the fun on the raft, and a lot could be done with crafting and storage to make it feel better as a whole. I'd also really like some way to protect my raft from the shark rather than just stronger plates that can take more damage. it takes about 20 hours or so, at least for the average gamer, to unlock all the items and after that there really isn't much more to do. The first chapter was pretty quick and there was a lot of text to read that I wasn't interested in because i don't enjoy reading that much lore personally. There are many little things I would alter but for what the game is, it kept me busy for a couple days even if it was kind of frustrating and clunky.If you're looking for other aquatic survival recommendations after playing Raft, or if this particular game doesn't snag you, I would point you towards Subnautica/Below Zero.",N/A

Both are solved by the mind-numbing endeavor of hooking garbage out of an ocean that must be off the coast of New York.  The game encourages you to sit your raft idly by one of these endless rivers of refuse and build it out using the lumber, plastic, and palm fronds you gather in the incredibly simple and fun-obliterating minigame of throwing a crappy plastic hook into the sea to get more plastic to make more hooks to get more plastic.In my two hours of gameplay, my friend and I saw exactly two points of interest.  Another floating raft, which took us an in-game day to paddle/sail over to, and rewarded us with a pittance of mundane resources that could have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage-hooking for a minute or so.  Worse still, this expedition took us away from the great garbage river, denying us the resources necessary to fight the ever-present spectre of thirst, hunger, and the shark-anarchist that seemed hellbent on destroying our raft and nothing else.  As they do.Second, we saw a small island.  Again we sailed away from our newly found garbage river to explore the island.  It was not only tiny, but incredibly mountainous, ensuring that not only did we get another pittance of resources, making the expedition worse than trash-farming, but we could not explore the entirety of the island due to the size of our raft.  A problem which could only be solved with another few hours doing time in the tedious deluge of rubbish that seems to be the centerpiece of this game.I've never refunded a game before Raft, but thank god I only played 116 minutes instead of five minutes more.  If not for my refund, then for my sanity as a person with an IQ greater than that of the seagulls in this game, which seemed hellbent on ramming their heads over and over into our mainsail.  I give this game zero stars, and may god have mercy on your soul if you accidentally played more than two hours.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Ağustos 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI love crafting/survival games but this just didn't do it for me... too empty, too tedious.  It might be better if you play with someone, but if you plan on playing solo I can't recommend it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 9 Eylül 2022To begin, i played with a group of 4 on multiplayer, normal mode.The first 20 hours of the journey was actually enjoyable. getting food was difficult, shark attacked a ton and you scrapped to get by.The second 20 hours the game gets really boring. most players would think the game scales difficulty with progression... well not this game. once you get ahead in resources and make a decent raft that is shark proof, has a bunch of nets, and is automated, has farms, power, etc... well theres nothing to do at this point except complete the story... well thats the issue.The story is garbage! idk why people think its a good one, because the ending is complete trash filled with obstacle courses. a ton of it is too easy with no mob scaling. to be honest, the underwater boss is more difficult and fun than the end.Most of all, you feel like you wasted time. when you spend hours and hours on farming because you think you are going on an epic adventure that will actually require resources, just to find out that you dont need to do that at all!5/10 - Good start, Terrible end.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game being so highly rated is kind of a mystery to me. So much of the game is having your resources whittled away by food creation(water, cooking, both take wood).Playing with a friend on easy we soon realized there really isn't anything to do once you take away that food loop- on paper the raft thing sounds fun...but in practice? (Gave up after we attempted to build a smelter and it would take us another 2 islands of just looking for sand deposits).Being on a raft really kills your ability to choose what to do- should you go out exploring? improve your base? gather some resoruces? Well on a raft- you can't really ""go out exploring"", if the game says no islands you get no islands. Pretty much you wait on your raft managing your food/water and mindlessly fishing for things. Which is fine except not for the core of your game.I do like that coop/MP was put into the game and its pretty seamless except...yay now we have TWO people to sit on a raft doing not much. More fun sure, but everything is more fun in coop.If you want to legitimately explore an ocean play subnautica. If you really really like food management I recommend ARK. Just don't see a niche for this game. Maybe if you really like that one mario party 1 minigame where you fish with the giant hands.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 10 Temmuz 2022Rafting game which is good until very last story quest titled UTOPIA.   Some puzzles which are not too hard to solve but then you get to a jumping course which is beyond frustrating.  It is garbage and makes no sense in this game.  Literally tried jumping the course which has about 5-6 obstacles and makes you repeat if you fail.  Obstacle #3 was beyond ridiculous and spent about 30mins to an hour trying. This is frustrating since you cant proceed and end the story line.  It is an absolute piece of junk move the devs added and makes no sense in this type of game.  I would not recommend wasting the hours and money on this due to this area.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 2022Like many survival games, great idea, poor implementation.The main conceit of Raft is that your base moves through the world.  This is a wonderful idea as you're not tied to one location.  Exceptional in a world which is 99.9% covered in water.The building is decent.  Snapping parts works well enough.  Part selection is a bit tepid and, having watched a few LPers, it seems like they are unaware of anything other than the basic parts.  The game does not give much incentive to explore the other part options when the basic options ""will do.""Core progression is servicable.  However, it suffers from the same problem most survival games suffer from.  What you're doing in the first hour is much the same as what you're doing 10 hours in which is much the same as 40 hours in.  The only difference between the three is slightly better (and often immaterial) stats on your tools coupled to a texture change.  Playing inventory tetris the first hour or three is fine.  Dozens of hours in, not so much.All of the above can be tolerated if the combat or story or progression systems are tight.  They are anything but.* Combat is, bad.  If anyone were to play this game I would recommend peaceful because anything other than that is just an exercise in frustration.  Your basic weapon is a spear.  A spear that is modeled to look like it has a reach of about 4 feet.  The in-game animation has you shuffle it like 3 inches with the reach to match.  The hit boxes on enemies are perplexing.  I've seen LPers, and experienced, where my weapon looks like it connects and no hit is registered.  Given that you have to instantly react to the Shark attacking your Raft or lose a tile, this is simply inexcusable.* inventory swapping feels sluggish and often you can get locked out of swapping completely.  Shark attack while you're reeling in something from the ocean?  Too bad, you can't just swap and lose the reel.  Eat, drink, place animations lag behind the actual action, leading to double usage.  And most animations look like they were made by the shyest person ever, or one who is bound in shibari.* Sounds are muddled and indistinct.  Was that a shark attacking your raft or your rope traps gathering several items at once.  Who knows!  You better react to both the same way lest you loose another tile from your raft!* Some progression comes from blueprints you have to find in the world.  Which go into your inventory.  Some instantly unlock crafting items.  Some don't.  Some require you to place it in the research bench first.  And none are consumed on use which leads the player to hold on to them ""just in case"".  In a game with very limited inventory space.* Birds attack crops.  OK, interesting mechanic.  You scare them off.  They fly through walls.  Uhm...I like the idea, I really do.  I want to like the game.  But when every system in the game, aside from the wonderful building portion, feels like it is 3 polish passes short of being frustration free, I'm just going to have to put this game down and tell others to give it a pass.  This is a game best enjoyed vicariously through a Let's Play.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Ağustos 2022Raft is tricky to review. The initial loop of gather, expand, and explore is excellent. The first half of the game is a ton of fun and one of the best survival games out there. Then it turns into a terrible game.Problem is that the developers seemingly forgot they were making a survival game halfway through and tried to become a point and click puzzle game with combat. The islands start getting to big, the puzzles are boring, and the game starts to become tedious. You'll end up getting new technology too late for it to be worth using.As you play it also become apparent that the game has some severe flaws in the tech tree that detract from it. You never really get past needing to farm large amounts of seaweed and metal. It really feels like there is an early plastic tier, an early game plastic tier, and this end game tier that isn't worth using.By the end of this game you'll feel it went on for 8 hours too long. It really could have used more time in early access. There should have been less focus on adding low quality story islands and more focus on the core of the game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 12 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt's a pretty bland game, the main enemy is over used and bceomes really predictable, momentary events of excitement also become really mundane at worst being a nuisance to development. You are really just waiting for things to float into your raft, collect them, store them, expand... So the game doesn't really develop anywhere, it's a raft building game, it's barely a survival game except for the first few hours when you maybe don't realize what you have to do to keep up your draining stats. However once you become fearless of the shark, or you decide to do the more arduous farming, and once you figure a better water purification system, it's just not a thing to worry about anymore.So the shark being the one other constant in the game, could do with a little personality, maybe be a little less predictably evil and menacing behaviour. Sharks are far more interesting when you don't know exactly what they will do. It would be great if it wasn't there, ALWAYS, or if it was, it wasn't 100% of the time going after you once it gets within a certain distance after which is will always come back. Rather, would develop as a threat if you kept doing something, like injuring yourself in the water, splashing arround on a makeshift paddle board. Fish a lot for sustenance, or spend a lot of time under water. If all you are doing is farming potatoes on a boat, relaxing in the sun, it's just annoying that the shark keeps attacking your boat. Sure you could playcreative, but again this is just to illustrate that this game is a constant bland stream of content and upkeep. Hats off to you if this is what you want, there is comfort in repetition and prep, this game has plenty of it. I just got a job so, got that quota filled.Progression is convoluted, mostly just ""Hey did I do this? Yep, what abouit this?"" as you look in the research book for things to click research on. It just doesn't feel like proper development and you are done with it pretty quick. It would be fantastic if this was some kinda game that required time, al lthe while that f'ing shark is chewing at your raft. The tommorrow children had a great slider puzzle system, that took either skill or time, something like that to make it a little more involved.Crafting feels very forced, with everything wearing down. I'm surprised the sail doesn't just wilt before my eyes, clearly the most valueable thing in the game. Resources are also just too random, untill you start farming, yey. Then it's just a calcuilated trade of scrap metal (Really important) into wood (get a ton of this, from floating around) The game should be called Floaty Farm with the ammount you'll be doing that. Just research collection nets, make as wide a raft as possible, basically a big circle and just wherever you go you're in the loot.Otherwise as said above the game is just a constant flow, it keeps going, nothing ever happens. Untill you build everything and you get a nominal payoff from playing the game for roughly 10 hours, after which it just returns to the same game with one extra thing you can do to make farming (collecting) stuff easier. It's like a cookie clicker with a hunger and thirst system that threatens to end your game before you want it to really. It's portrayed as a chill experience but does its best to just annoy you with little things constantly, while you're trying to get to that zen moment of not needing anything more, guess that's the end game. It comes arround eventually, once you make the choice to just farm materials for a few hours, you'll have enouigh to just quit, build as impressive a raft as you want. I've played maybe 13 hours (I spent a lot of time in the menu, having left the game on over night once or twice)It could use a bit more polish, especially in the sound department, it's mostly just a collection of white noise looping, doesn't really bring out the feeling of being on the ocean. Music is awkward, pseudo Minecraft kind of stuff, first thing to do in game is to turn it off. The game starts off with a huge musical score for no aparent reason, get hyped for waiting for trash to float by you, wooh! Music should be there to focus and draw your attention to the little details, not just randomly played for the sake of having it.The gameplay could do with a little polish as well, it's very stunted, and jerky feeling. Things feel delayed, slow, and badly paced. Even being in the water is awkward, basic swim up and down controls would be good, but right now you only go forwards and backwards and up. For some reason the developer decided to add in space controls, so you can turn the world upside down if you look down far enough, but when that happens left and right are reversed so... Vomit warning? It would be really cool if the game properly simulated the sensation of being in a moving fluid, but that's maybe asking a little too much consdering the hook physics are as basic as they are.You'll be sure to go over your 2 hour trial so really consider what you do in the first hour, as that's the game for the next 13 hours too! Here's hoping my 20$ goes to developing the game further, but right now it's just not worth it.Now many people would say, ""You got 13 hours of gameplkay out of this game, how is that not enough for 20$?"" and I'll say, that was more like 10 hours of work, and lets give a generous 3 hours of wonder and actual excitement to the different keystones of the game. And it is work, it's not enjoyable. You are kept away from even looking at the game, islands pass you by as you try to figure out a better way to sort your stuff out. The game really needs a bit of adversity. Storms are things that should be avoided, navigation should be eventually possible (In a sense it is, with the radar, however this is just a way to reliably find islands in a sense, abit more creative though.) What I'm really hoping this game does is eventually make a larger explorable location and I'm guessing that's their plan. It would really be nice if you could explore a larger space before leaving and starting the ""travel float"" to find a new such location. The game also needs more variety in terms of enemies. Finding eels when collecting scrap on the side of islands, jellyfish schools drifting arround, maybe even predator birds that you need to hunt down. That shark needs to take a chill pill, maybe have more of them though, a little variety maybe even entire schools of sharks to make it so you defineatly don't want to make the mistake of catching their attention. It would be great if your actions, like trapping fish for too long in collection nets is what triggered the shark to attack your raft rather then it being a timer based eventuallity. Storms and being next to islands while they happen should be among the most dangerous events, if you see/hear a storm coming, you just go. Being in a storm , you'd want to hunker in, the waves could wash you off. Would mean you'd want to build a home more then a sea trash collection rig. If the game had these systems in such a balance that you could loose your raft, compeltely but survive with a makeshift flotation device/vest and find yourself on an island or something to start again would be great. Once you have a set of tools, all the research done, you kind of want to start again.Anyway, that's a long rant. I really want this game to be more survival, less Raft... Not quite the same level as Subnautica, even 2 years ago, but it's got a glint of something in it's eyes. I guess once twitch streamers that normally don't play these kinda games start playing this game, pay attention, but otherwise, maybe if it's priced down to 10$ or less get it. 10 or so hours of gameplay pretty much assured, it has multiplayer too. Didn't try that though.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 15 Şubat 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiVery great game with TONS and TONS of potential! Loved the itch.io FREE version as well. But my god the amount of bugs!I have encountered dozens of them and some are very game breaking. Take note as this game is a whopping 20$.Scarecrows not doing there f****** job! I have seen birds flying into my crops (flew with the eating animation) and pecking at them and the scarecrow does nothing!Materials not spawning. I had just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my base set up when the game decides to screw me over and only allow materials to spawn if I am going right.Sometimes eating food didn't do anything. I was hungry and would try to eat but guess 5 f****** baked potatoes  isn't enough for my fat-assAside from the bugs the game is boring as hell with tons of minor annoyances that don't need to be there! You cant dive into the water without the shark biting you like it hasn't eaten in a month which is really annoying because for bricks you need (2) sand and (2) clay which are both found by going underwater and mining them which you cant mine even 2 without getting bit. Considering you need 5 DRY bricks to create a furnace that's gonna take you a long time to get.Another spit in the face is that the devs aren't worried at all about creating new content no, no, no you know what this game really needs? Tiny little details and annoyances to slow the game down. What goes through the devs heads when they are add a feature that you cant create seeds from plants and need to go to a island to replace your watermelons that only give you 1/4 water and 1/16 food. Oh right I forgot I won world championship hot dog eating contest and can shovel 10 baked potatoes down before I am even starting to feel full.Overall a great game on itch.io but 20$ for this? No thank's! Please consider all these ""features"" before purchasing.(P.S.

"Yayınlanma: 29 Haziran 2021Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiTL; DR: Don't get this if you're gonna play the No-friends Edition (Singleplayer).A weird one. A really weird one.I've had this game on my wishlist for quite some time and just waited for a sale. Summersale and with it the discount arrived and I bought it. I like survival games, I like challenging games, I like the scenery (ocean, islands etc.) and I like basebuilding. All of that in a game with 93% positive user reviews, what could go wrong? Aparently, more than I thought.I created my first world, harvested some materials from the ocean and enjoyed the beginning. Maybe 15 minutes into the game I spotted a small island and of course I wanted to check it out. As my character was already close to dehydration and starvation I thought that the island might provide me with some supplies. So I jumped off my raft, got onto the small and very empty island and within a split second everything was gone. Island gone, raft gone, floating materials in the ocean gone, even the shark was gone. There was nothing left for me to do but to start over. That bug only occured once and fortunaly it happened very early, so I didn't loose that much. Still not a very encouraging way to start into a game I just bought.So I started another world and immediately worked towards a grill and a water purifier as I had learned that food and water decrease quite fast. And here is the thing. I know this can be played in Co-op, but I present to you the ultimate surprise: Some people try to play this alone.The amount of time it took to create fresh water and to gather the rescources (planks) to keep the fire for both the purifier and the grill up made me spend a solid 15 minutes just to work my food and hydration bar all the way up and then having a timeframe from 5-10 minutes where I could finally focus on sth. else before I'd have to do it all over again. During that food+water chore time the annoying shark kept destroying my raft, which wouldnt be a problem, except it costs a lot of rescources to rebuild what he just destroyed. So while growing food, grilling it, gaining water and purifying it I also had to use my hook to ""fish"" for new materials (mainly planks). That required 100% of the time I had on my hands, I wasn't able to check the crafting menu properly, browse the base building parts or anything else. Because that shark kept destroying my raft I then built a weapon (a simple wooden spear) to fight him off. No matter how quick I was, the shark still managed to damage the raft and repairing it cost rescources again. Then I realised that every item I use gets damaged and breaks over time, apparently with no chance to repair it. Meaning, you always need to craft new spears, paddles, the hooks to gather materials, anchors etc. All that lead to a chore where I was hardly able to have a look around, plan my journey or spend rescources on expanding the raft. 2/3 of the time I worried about the ridiculously fast decreasing food/water bar, 1/3 of the time I spent with the stuff mentioned above. Replacing broken tools, repairing the raft and fishing for the bare minimum of rescources in the ocean to keep me alive and going.Don't get me wrong, it was do-able, but it was far from relaxing and left me with no time for actual exploring. Just a never ending chore to fulfill the basic needs. It wasn't challenging or interesting, it was just annoying.There might be a point later on in the game where this becomes easier, but when I finally killed a shark that left me with shark-meat and the grilled shark meat only gave me a gain of about 1/4 of the food bar, I saw no point and joy in continuing.I play games like Raft to chill, to have a look around what the world around me has to offer and to build a nice base (or raft in this case). I would have been interested in the story it has to offer, too. All these artifical micromanagement ""challenges"" kept me from being able to do that. It left me wondering if these chores are in place to cover up a shallow world and too little content to justify its price tag and its long existence within Early Access.It doesn't really matter to me if the experience is different in co-op mode. This game is listed as Singleplayer, too. If you focus all your mechanics on co-op gameplay, make it co-op only and I know what I'm getting into. But this isn't the case and as a Singleplayer experience I can under no circumstances recommend this game, even at a discounted price.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 28 Temmuz 2018Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiI think that this game is garbage. the game seems like your avrage survival crafting game with its own twist, and its an intresting idea on paper but at the end of the day its still bad 98% of the game is grinding in the worst way possible, all you do is sit in one spot and throw a hook at passing garbage... with the same moddels... the same thing... the entire time. whats that other 2% you may ask, well the other 2 percent is the mild satisfaction you get when you finally against all odds find what you were looking for to build a thing so that you can then use that thing to help you grind again and its an endless cycle and not the good kind like other survival games. being on the raft is a cool idea but again on paper it sounds good but its still not because theres no expance to explore sure you can build out the ship but once you get it to a decent size theres never a reason to expand again. you will occasionaly come across a small island with soem things on it but the island is no wider than the decent size i mentiond for your ship and you may also come across another raft that when you hop on will start sinking you grab the one supply box on it and its never seen again untill you come across another raft that does the same thing. point is this game is very boring and not worth 20 bucks. maybe it will be in the future and i get this is an early access game but in its current state i'd say its worth about 5 bucks.P.S. I did not forget about the sharks they are just as boring as the abandoned raft and the island you build up to kill it and then another one comes you achive nothing but getting a useless shark head and some meat.Fin",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 3 Eylül 2022Would ""Meh"" if it was an option.The game starts out pretty promisingly. Just yourself, a couple of tools, and a wide ocean for you to explore. You explore story islands, unlock new technologies that make your life easier or open up new aspects of the game. I had the best time here, exploring, struggling to stay alive, gathering resources to make my life easier, etc.  The first three story islands were great. Slowly scaling up, but still feeling worth exploring.But then the story islands just start getting worse, bit by bit.  Larger islands, less to find, more maze-like, worse looting experience (I hope you like opening individual drawers to see if anything is inside), annoying gimmicks. Balance of later unlocks feels off (a fuel-powered battery charger is almost completely obsoleted just two islands later).I have a wide variety of issues with the game, but none are crippling. The upshot is that there seems to be a reasonably healthy modding community for the game; I look forward to seeing the added potential the modding community brings.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 12 Temmuz 2018After version 1.0 i think the fairest review I can give is:The Developers are clearly very lazy. The environments are unfinished and in the newer content, huge holes which you can fall into and get stuck and have to wait for the Unstuck option to become available.The survival mechanics are absurd. Even in a Video game a human being shouldn't need to eat two sharks and drink 10 gallons of water every day to survive. The tools break WAY too quickly and so you spend most of the time, even in Late game frantically rushing around trying to manage your food and hunger, lest you end up having to deal with the even more absurd penalty for being hungry or thirsty.Game developers use these kinds of mechanics to distract the player from the lack of anything else to do, which in this case is unnecessary because there are actually plenty of other things to do. Had they spent more time creating different islands to visit to make the island hopping aspect of which this game is mainly comprised less tedious.So crappy game mechanics and tedious gameplay are the main reasons why I don't recommend this game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 23 Ağustos 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt's hard to play a survival game that isn't Subnautica after playing Subnautica.After nearly 20 hours, the game is...Ok. The pace of progression is a little slow when you don't know what you are doing. There also doesn't actually appear to be an endgame.Why am I not gonna play anymore? You see in Easy mode, it says you don't lose your stuff when you die. There is no note as to what happens with your stuff when you die on Normal. What I inferred was that on normal, you drop your stuff on the spot that you died. That would make sense. No, friend. When you die, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gone. Just gone. Poof. You had a bunch of metal tools, bow, metal arrows, etc? Well get rekt. Hardcore, I'd understand. But better yet, once you die, it autosaves. Never taken on hostile fauna on a big island before? Sucks to be you. You lose your stuff and you can't even load a save to get back to where you were.So if you love survival games, and you know going into this that the game WILL screw you for dying, sure consider picking this up.

"Yayınlanma: 31 Temmuz 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiPlayed this back when it was an Itch.io game. I enjoyed the game then. It was fun up to a certain point before it became dull from repetition. Now, it is just dull through out. It is a constant steady flow of activity with very few small blips of change to it, like a flat-lined heart monitor where you are waiting on a heartbeat to happen. Just anything to break the steady monotony of that tone. It is also far buggier than it was during the itch.io days with certain elements being very inconsistent from one play session to the next.It is listed as a survival game but in my opinion it barely qualifies as that.  You have to worry about being eaten by a shark, drowning, and of course food/water. Beyond that there is really nothing survival about it. It also ignores certain survival elements such as rain serving to water your outside farming crops and never needing any method to start a fire.Then there are the islands you are supposed to climb and get supplies from. In most cases, the only way to get to the top of the taller islands is to have an unrealistically tall raft. This is because simple things like building a ladder can only be done on the raft itself and not on land which would be logical to allow for.There are currently a lot of really positive reviews for this game, but I cannot give a positive review myself when this game feels so lost in the direction it is going. It needs improvement in the survival aspect, improvement in the building mechanics, and especially improvement in general mechanics and bug fixes.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 28 OcakIt baffles me how this piece of garbage got such high praise.I’m not the biggest fan of Survival Crafting games, but I have enjoyed my share of The Forest, Subnautica, Rust and some other games. Raft is so bad that I feel bad comparing it to them.When a Survival game releases in 2022, you’d expect a certain level of quality. There have been no shortage of survival games in the past years to take lessons from. Raft decides to take lessons from none. It feels so basic, primitive, crude, unrewarding and overall badly designed that it baffles me as to how it is possible. How can you not eventryand copy what made the other games fun? The legacy, early access version of Rust which released in 2013 was designed better than this “released” game of 2022.Let me break down the horrible designs of this game:Poor Feedback and no “Oomph”Whenever you do something in a game, you get feedback that shows what you did actually had an effect. For example, in a shooter game, when you fire your gun, you see the muzzleflash and hear the gunshot sound. This is feedback that you did indeed shoot your gun. But it doesn’t end there; Here is where the “oomph” comes in.If you take that same gunshot, add a heavy recoil animation, make the sound louder, punchier and add a screen-shake effect to it, now the feedback feels much more powerful. You didn’t fire an airsoft gun, you fired a 7.62 rifle which packs a punch. Now not only do you know you fired a round, but you also enjoyed firing it, even if there was nothing to shoot at.This oomph is a nice-to-have feature in games, but in survival crafting games it is necessary, because everything you’re doing is tedious labor, like chopping trees, hitting rocks, gathering food etc. So bringing that oomph to the player’s actions turns these tedious tasks into addictive dopamine releases.Raft has the minimum level of feedback and nothing close to an oomph. When you’re hitting a tree with an axe, you don’t swing your axe to deliver a powerful blow. No, you gently poke your axe on the tree. Imagine holding an axe, moving your hand 5cm forward and calling that a swing. It’s pathetic.The sound it produces is weak, the particle effects dull, the tree receives no effect (like scars, shaking etc.) and overall it feels so weak that it actually breaks immersion.This goes onto every other aspect of the game too. Stabbing an animal? Barely any effects so you’re not sure if you’re actually doing any damage. Chopping up the corpse to take meat? Same animation as picking up an object until the corpse fades out.All of this makes the game as tedious as you could imagine, to the point where you would have more fun doing all that labor in real life than you are doing in game.UnrewardingIn good games, you either need a lot of materials, which means you get a bunch from each resource node, or you need few materials, and so resource nodes yield less materials.For example: In Rust you need a lot of materials. You need a dozen pieces of wood to make a wall. Chopping down a tree yields 30 wood. In Subnautica, you need 4 titanium to make a room. You either find one titanium in every outcrop (which there are a lot of), or you find a metal sheet and get four (which is more sparse).This balance makes it so that you don’t find yourself rich with resources or barely scraping by and not being able to make anything.Raft throws all of that out of the window by requiring lots of materials while also barely giving you any.Found a palm tree after fifteen minutes of floating? Chop it down and only receive max three wood pieces. Now you still don't have wood and also your axe lost ¾ of its durability which leads me to the next problem: Every single tool breaks so quickly that half of the resources you gather are spent on making more.You need twelve wood? Well gather some with your hook. You got it? Great! Too bad your hook broke so you need to use three of the wood plus rope to make the hook again.Want to cook food? Sure! Just catch some fish with the fishing rod. The rod broke? At least you got this small sardine, cook that. Oh wait, you also need wood cause this grill eats two pieces of wood for every sardine.Basically you are always in need of resources, every tool you have keeps breaking on the tenth use, and finding any type of resource node, be it a tree, rock, crate etc. yields so little resource that it’s almost not worth gathering.Empty WorldThere are very few creatures and interactables in this game, and sometimes it is just stupidly un-immersive. Remember how palm trees yielded so little rewards? Well luck’s on your side because you just found an island covered with a lush jungle. Wood paradise right? Wrong. All the trees are decorative and you can't harvest them.Think about it. You want wood. You find an island full of it and you can't get any. Why? Cause sh*t game design, that’s why.I could go on about this like the previous problems but I guess that single example was enough to show how stupid it is.Campaign and StoryBasically the story revolves around you finding coordinates to a new island, exploring it to find the coordinates to the next one and setting sail to it once again to repeat it.Now this doesn’t sound too bad on paper, since for the other part of the game you’re just floating around on the water. But I sh*t you not, floating aimlessly on the ocean is actually more fun than these islands.Almost every island is designed to make you wander them in search of stuff for at least an hour. The further you go, the longer it takes. It always requires you to find a needle in a stack of hay. Combine this with the fact that the islands are void of any un-scripted interaction (remember the jungle with decorative trees) and you got the most tedious part of the game. Even more than resource hunting.The whole game comes to a complete stop because now you have to spend two hours on this god forsaken island to find the next piece of blueprint you need, all the while not being able to gather any resources and slowly running out of everything.OthersI got a few more things to talk about but I’ll sum them up so we can go home:The crafting menu always opens with the inventory menu and actually covers up to 40% of the whole inventory screen. Also the windows cannot be moved so it’s always like this.There is a bug in multiplayer where you can get stuck in the inventory screen of a crate. You can’t do anything but move (no mouse movement though). Even the Escape button doesn’t work so you have to alt+F4 and restart the whole game and server.Trying to eat cooked food (anything that isn’t grilled) requires you to use clay bowls. This wouldn’t be bad if it weren’t for the fact that every bowl is a one-time use item. Wtf, do you eat your clay bowl for dessert?Combat/hunting is pathetic.Enemies cannot possibly be more annoying.Dying makes you lose ⅔ of your inventory and damages everything that is left by 50%.The shark is made so virtually difficult that it instantly breaks immersion every time you jump in the water.Floating resources have the worst collider (hitbox) possible when trying to hook.ConclusionThis is a piece of sh*t. Literal sh*t. How it got such a high score baffles me. Either the reviewers have not played any other survival games, or standards have dropped so low that anything is praised these days.At the time of writing, I’ve played for 21 hours on co-op with my friend. I have only been able to truly enjoy it for the last 2 hours. That means the other 19 hours have been nothing but pain.So no, I wouldn’t recommend this crap, even to my enemies. Even if it was free game, I wouldn't suggest wasting time on it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 31 Mayıs 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesi----==== UDPATED 25/6/2022 ====----In short, much of what I talk about in earlier versions of the review hold true, however now that the final chapter is released and I've reached the endgame it's time to talk about the 'complete' game such as it is.Building mechanics have been hugely improved with the inclusion of horizontal supports which allow you to build so very much more with whatever you can imagine.Sadly, there are three aspects that just don't work at all about this game and because they are linked to progression I can't really recommend the game at full price. First up is the movement system. The devs have included so much annoying platforming that the clunky, imprecise, and unresponsive control system actively stands in the way. A friend who bought the game hated the platforming aspects so much that they gave up on the game entirely. The shame of this is that without the platforming you just cannot progress. I powered through the sections, but they are undoubtedly the lowlights of the game. The system just wasn't designed very well for this. Perhaps a future bigfix will address this, but until it is, the game actively suffers as a result.Secondly, the boss fights and puzzles. Mostly straightforward when you have solved them, but they're not the most friendly to players who aren't buying into this game for the story or platforming. What I mean by that, is that some players will just want to build out their raft and will skip through all the notes. They will maybe collect them but won't necessarily read them. They're more interested in the blueprints. For those players this is a 'one route' type of game. There is just one route to complete the story, so it expects players to play a certain way.Finally, I really wish all game devs would learn not to hide really useful things behind the final boss. Having the titanium tools, and the electronic zipline hidden so late into the game it felt very much 'oh okay, well that's anti-climactic'. Had those blueprints been something cool like a faster engine, or something that would further incentivise building out your raft that might have been better. It's minor gripe though.In addition to these still stand all my prior thoughts. The building aspect is great. The flexibility of the building is great. Sadly, with so long given to development, the game just feels unpolished. That's a great shame, because there is a real gem here.---=== The Original Review ===---I played a version of Raft around about five years ago now before the story stuff started to appear....back on itch.ioEven in Early Access, this is actually a good game. Though I will be clear, if Early Access lasts more than a year for a AAA or three for an indie, I don't cut the game any slack for being in Early Access.  So read my criticisms knowing that.--== What Works Well ==--BUILDING & DECORATINGThe building of the raft is awesome. Absolutely wonderful. I have managed to build whatever I can imagine and that is something I absolutely adore about a game like this. It wasn't too long before my raft looked more like a ship. So, if you like base building survival games this is a great game to check out for a reasonable price.PROGRESSION & RESEARCHI love the idea of having to visit different locations in order to make progress. Researching all the different items you can pick up is as simple as plugging an item in. No tedious wait timers, the limiting factor is that you might sacrifice a valuable item to make progress. It just works well. Visiting new islands initially makes the game feel quite large and helps to feel like you're moving forward. The only downside is how small the world feels when you've seen the same island for what feels like the 10th time around.SURVIVALA lot of survival games make the process of survival an annoyance rather than a resource balancing exercise. Being able to eat while walking makes a massive difference and is a good quality of life thing,SOCIAL/ONLINEBeing able to simply, quickly and easily join a game with my sister to work together is an advert for how to do co-op building games properly. It's easy and intuitive. The vast majority of the hours put into the game are with other people and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.--== What Doesn't Work Well ==--PLATFORMING & MOVEMENTThe story locations require a LOT of platforming. For game that has been built largely around the building aspect it seems very odd that there is a LOT of fiddly platforming. The game engine just doesn't feel built for such movement. There needs to be a much better movement and control system to justify the rather long and tedious platforming areas (Caravan Town for example). Cynical though it makes me, it feels like the developers had an idea for a different game and instead of making a different game rolled it into this one to save money and resources. If progress wasn't locked behind odd platforming areas this wouldn't be an issue.SMALL WORLDOnce you've got engines for your raft the world begins to feel extremely small. By that point you've probably seen most of the island types many times over which makes the world feel tiny and boring. If the game hadn't been in development for over five years at this point, this would be forgiveable, but with so much extra being added to the game over the last few years it's long past time to add in a greater variety of island types.--== Is it worth buying? ==--Yes. If you like building survival games, Raft is well worth the £20. There's an evolving story, and a really good base building mechanic. The co-op mode is utterly entertaining and actually feels like the way the game is meant to be played. Assuming that the devs actually finish off the story, there's still more to come. Given how long it's been in Early Access though, there's always a big red flag. There is a complete game hiding here with very little extra work however, which is why I do recommend it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhen the main part of the gameplay is based on you being on a raft, there has  to be a lot of stuff to do on said raft that feels rewarding.. but that's not the case",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 MartWant a fun game with great potential and a wet fart of a finish? Look no further.I enjoyed my time with the game until the last two story islands. The pacing was a little weird, and I had to complete about half the game before I felt comfortable leaving my raft for any amount of time, but that gave me the opportunity to farm resources a bit and enjoy the vibes. Really fun, especially great with multiplayer.What went wrong? You can tell what parts of the game were developed when and how much testing they got. For example, every fun little furniture item for your raft can only be crafted with basic flotsam instead of any precious materials. This would be fine, except it feels like a missed opportunity that I can't use metal or copper or glass or titanium to make more varied or interesting decorations. Just whatever they came up with in the first few patches.Alright, but what about the story? I'm not really a story guy, so I didn't find it very compelling of a narrative. To each their own.The real biggest problem is that this fun little collection/survival game decides it wants combat at the last second. Despite not being designed for it in any way shape or form, the last couple islands has you completing puzzles while struggling for your life. To put it bluntly, it feels janky. This needed another couple passes at least, and combat puzzles feels like the last thing this game needed. For example, in the last boss fight, you hear someone yell ""it's no use! you can't pierce his hide!"" I took that to mean that, just like every other obstruction in the game, pure killing wouldn't be the answer. What the game meant was ""this boss enters invincibility sometimes, so just get out of the way"". I lost my entire inventory because of that fight.Speaking of, dying in this game is a real drag. I'm all for punishments for making mistakes, such as being pushed back on progress or only allowing a certain amount of failures, but these items can take 20-40 minutes to reliably farm. Losing 2/3rds of your inventory each death means dozens of rare materials poof into thin air because the devs wanted a combat arena at the last second. Nice. Thanks.Overall, I came back to this game because I enjoyed the feeling of making a raft that really felt like my own and setting up automated systems of taking care of my various survival needs. That feeling still strongly resonates the entire playthrough. Once you've been sent to an arctic island, you can just drop the game if you're not feeling it. The rest the game has to offer is very lackluster and you'll feel bad for having wasted your time.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 12 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiConceptually, this game is lovely, its atmospheric, and at first glance it has a good concept. Here in lies the problem. The developer of this game is literally no better than a scam artist publisher. Their games Raft and Scrap Mechanic suffer from the exact same problem of ""Buy this for an early access product, we swear we'll deliver, even as we put out new Early access games to pilfer your money.""Truthfully the reality is, no, each update from this publisher takes on average 6 or more months, and while they hype it up, the reality is its purely false advertisement and the content they release is barely anything. For Raft the latest update adds a grand total, of two hours of content. Even if you replay it from the start it won't even make a difference. I held off refunding this game along with their other product purely in hopes that this was an honest developer, I am filled with regret in that regard and sincerely feel that Axelot games is an incredibly dishonest developer.For all those who are considering this, unless you have friends and you purely enjoy playing atmospheric games designed to be annoying beyond splitting minor tasks with minimal content to play through, and perhaps enjoy the fun of building a neat little raft for all of the few hours you can play.

Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 2022I've liked raft for a while.  It's always been buggy.  But this latest update...  Omg.  The blue screens of death especially starting the game up.  They can't seem to figure out audio glitches.  Some serious stability work needs to be done by this dev team.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 23 Ağustos 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiLet's be honest. It's a nice game for a few hours but gets boring really quick. Everything is very repetitive and the ""story"" or the goal is just.......disappointing. It's basically you on a raft along with a stupid crow and an annoying shark, trying to gather materials while passing the same islands over and over again until you got enough stuff to finish your objective. Nothing to explore, nothing to really fight against (besides the survival aspects) and the biggest danger is to fall off the Raft while it floats away so you're unable to get back on it.It has potential but currently I can't recommend it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Ekim 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesi❤️I think the raft is a great and relaxing game but I think the one thing it lacks is content I got this because I was bored and played it for two days and somethings I noticed there’s not much to do in the beginning there’s a shark but he rarely shows up the one thing that killed me the most was falling of my ship or just running out of food but once you get those problems taken care of it’s just sitting on your ship waiting for something to show like a mountain or a relay station this game consists of waiting, gathering and then waiting that’s it❤️",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Haziran 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesi[FULL DISCLOSURE: When this game first came out I bought it, beat all the content it had in under 3 hours and refunded the game.  I got access to it again due to friends buying me a copy to ""try it now"" and these are my updated thoughts.  Understand I was skeptical going on and this may color my review a bit.]I'm gonna be brutally honest here and even though I have had some fun with this title...  I honestly DON'T recommend it.It's a kind of interesting twist on the admittedly very stale survival genre.  Instead of exploring all over the place you're sort of in a vast ocean scavenging the supplies you can while a shark stalks your (initially very) small raft.  As time goes on you upgrade and expand the raft, gaining more and more tools to speed things up and handle more.  The biggest issue is...The initial start is almost unbearably slow.  Since you cannot really actively go out looking for specific materials, you kind of just have to let them drift to you.  This really never changes: Aside for some specific resources you never can really TARGET some specific ones.  You can build nets that sort of passively collect things as they drift by and that can end up handling most of the resource gathering you need, but occasionally the game goes into droughts of resources spawning so you're kinda just... drifting.Until some later game upgrades as well you're kind of at the mercy of the current and the wind and have no real way to determine what is around or where to explore.  This can very easily end up getting you into sort of a rut where you're getting nothing done other than kind of stockpiling goods for no reason.The story is interesting enough and they've finally added to it in recent updates but it still feels kinda tacked on and it's one of those ""experienced after the fact/through journals/logs"" instead of an immediate, interesting story going on.  There's also a new type of enemy added at a certain point besides just the shark that feels added simply because every survival game has to have a variant of this creature.The hunger and thirst meter, unlike in some games, never really feels like a THREAT in this game, but it is definitely ANNOYING.  It drains just fast enough to need relatively constant attention but not so fast that by the time you notice it is low you're not SOL to do anything about it.Playing with friends is also simultaneously better AND worse, especially in the early game.  Early on there simply isn't enough for everyone to do or really even enough resources to go around.  The raft still starts at the same size it does for a single person and each person still has the same hunger/thirst requirements, making it hard to get by without making extra stations to purify the salt water or more grills, which in turn needs more space, which in turn - again - needs more resources.  And unlike other games, since you're all stuck on the same raft together, you can't really speed up the gathering process with a divide and conquer method.  Later on, though, as the raft expands bigger and you are juggling more resources and crafting facilities it can be useful to have multiple people focused on multiple things... but again that's primarily because you needed more resources for each person to begin with.I am not saying this is a bad game.  I do think there is fun to be had here and I personally have had some fun.  But the moments of fun have been pretty heavily overshadowed by some bugs or just sheer boredom/monotony as I wait for something new to come over the horizon.  The lack of player agency and choice early on really hurt the game and are absolute boredom and tedium in a survival game I think.So, in the end, I cannot RECOMMEND the game, though if you are a huge fan of survival games and want something a little different, you will probably enjoy your time with raft.Just... have a second screen on with Netflix or friends to talk to or something.  There are seriously some dull stretches in this thing.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiSo I played the Alpha build of this game, and it was surprisingly stable. Following the full release of the game, everything is much nicer looking, and mechanics have been refined. Islands are nice, when they're not three stories tall and therefore impossible to climb onto unless your raft is somehow both tall and agile enough to anchor nearby. i've got about six hours played thus far, and have already run into an issue where the game completely locks up, seemingly for no reason, causing me to force quit. The other issue occurs when the camera stops responding, so I can no longer turn to face different directions, making it pretty much impossible to keep playing normally. I like that you can now dive under water, but with how long it takes to kill the shark, how crappy shark bait is, and how quickly the shark respawns, it might as well be an unused mechanic. Having played on both Easy and Normal, I can say that Easy is still very challenging, or should I say frantic? It is a constant grind to keep food and water up, such that I am missing crucial supplies as I rush to and fro, watering plants and catching fish to keep from dying for the next two or three minutes. Speaking of supplies, the crafting recipes are so expensive, and gathering bulk supplies is so tedious, that I found myself forgoing anything beyond the basix necessities for survival. The Research table was a luxury I found myself avoiding after I built it, as my most basic materials went into the constant mainenance of my raft and replacement of the tools I so desperately needed in order to keep myself fed. Overall, a disappointing experience, one I found myself sighing and groaning over time and time again. Definitely not worth the 20 dollars I spent to play this as soon as it came out.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 OcakA shockingly boring, janky, buggy time waste that is every annoying thing about copy-paste survival game design wrapped in a story of, ""go here and read about the mildly interesting thing that happened off screen"". It's one novelty, the raft, isn't really anything special. Rather than walking over a pointlessly massive world slowly collecting resources to silence irritating meters, you slow traverse and literally barren one having resources drip fed to you. Until you hit an island. Then you get to deal with broken movement mechanics, unbalanced mobs and figuring out which 5% of the flora and fauna are of any use beyond decoration.The game stands as flawless evidence that the Steam review aggregate is utterly meaningless.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 8 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiIn the state its in I can't recommend it at all. I understand its buggy but like theres so much basic ♥♥♥♥ that can be fixed. The most annoying are as follows:- Eating and drinking goes down FAR too quickly on normal and hard modes. By the time you eat + drink and them go to do another thing, you need to eat and drink again.- Sharks glitching into the centre of the raft destroying foundation. Understandable if the ones on the edge are destroyed but the sharks glitch into the middle of the raft which seems to be a bug. If not then the animation for the shark biting the raft needs fixed.- Shark bite damage. The shark does literally no damage when you are in the water. It takes off so little damage apart from the first five minutes of spawning its basically no threat at all.Until at least the eating and drinking ♥♥♥♥ is fixed the game is unplayable. Other than this the game building etc is quite fun.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022I'm just going to be honest. My partner and I played this game when it first dropped and loved it. The concept and gameplay are great. We were so excited for when the final part of this game just came out. But it was short lived. - The ending is honestly very ordinary as well as Uptoia. Getting the tools as well at end game... why????? Why give the player the upgraded tools when the game is over and you no longer have use for them. Whoever thought that one through..... Clearly didn't think it through at all. This game had potential to continue to be amazing but we were both left with a sour taste. Shame.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 27 Kasım 2022death penalty is a scam on normal difficulty, while claiming it will take 2/3 of your inventory in reality it takes 80-90% and degrades all your tools to red. why don't you stop pretending death won't cost you that much and just remove all inventory? why do I need that 1 fish and 2 stones if it won't make me even simplest tool.shark and all other animals suck in combat because it's Unity game and not a single developer till date were able to make decent combat in their Unity game. controls are clunky, UI is bad and visuals are stock Unity crap you'll in even Unity game. Islands and vegetation looks just as ugly as in Stranded Deep (same assets?)often you will die because developers have no skills to program collision for objects. I know what's inside the enemies because they jump on my toon and they go through like ghosts, dealing damage while my toon has to make few steps back to hit them. every enemy has one attack pattern (hit, run, u-turn, jump) and it's so boring to shove 10 metal arrows into shark's open mouth (you can't hurt it from sides with bow for some odd reason), it swims in circles and often can jump on you out of nowhere as developers never bothered to make light in deep sea and you won't see any shark or anything else if you're fighting in the open area at night. such a waste of time waiting for every critter to circle and run back to you. rats have weird hitboxes so you can't hit them properly and it's hard to loot their shaken body because the hitbox is few pixels wide.difficulty options are bad. you can either play it without any danger from animals (and shark), play easy where you won't be scammed out of your inventory on death or play normal (sadistic version where you can barely survive first hours and then you fortify your raft and shark no longer bothers you). I believe this fortifying thing tries to hide issues with game balance, developers failed to provide meaningful survival, all difficulty goes from clunky controls, bad Unity issues (jumping on a raft and missing it (shark loves that one), just like it was in Stranded Deep, inability to hit enemy with melee weapon while it hits you repeatedly because Unity combat), toon has health for 3 hits and shark hits every 3 seconds if you're in water.peaceful mode isn't that peaceful as you still will have to fight enemies in story mode. and you need to finish story mode to unlock items for your raft.speaking of story mode, it sucked. they give you some random notes all voiced with some Khajiit accent, notes itself do not make any sense. I tried to follow the story but it's shallow, boring and I believe it shouldn't be there. it gates useful items and raft progression for no reason. another reason why I believe the story is a failure is forced platforming. jumping with Unity controls and physics is bad, and wasting hours on jumping is even worse. they have few levels where you miss the jump and have to redo whole section. platformer all out of sudden? no thanks.some kids when asked to clean their room would sweep all garbage under their bed (out of sight, out of mind). this game does the same for world objects. ocean is perfectly still and there's no current to take your raft anywhere. you stopped, all garbage stopped in the water. garbage generates only near your raft. jump into water and swim to see empty water without  a single object in it. same with islands you visit - only one side of an island gets resources spawned. sea bed is empty and the only thing you have is a shark who will follow you like a pet. that's lame. I understand performance issues but this game works like crap, looks like crap and still performs in 30-60 fps range. Unity engine can't cope with that, why everyone tries to create big worlds in it?Linux performance has -20 FPS out of 60 locked in Steam Play, played on Windows to have at least some fluid gameplay.I'm disappointed. there's no difficulty setting for a casual player where you at least keep your tools on death and can access all content (raft upgrades) without playing piss poor story mode. I'm surprised so many people praised this game, despite its obvious flaws.If you really want to play it, go for creative and forget combat. building raft is fun, everything else isn't.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ekim 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiI've played the game through by three times. It is an arcade fun, so to say. But the devs are just celebrating their success and only doing cheep community work, instead of finishing or at least adding some content to the game.It is quite a fun to play, but you get really fast to the end and this end is really pointless and sobering. At least a proper ending, they could have spent the game. But no.. They need two months for implenting a new cooking device and a usless swarm of fishes. This is about a one week development for an artist and the coder together. So not very much. Why raising all that money for early Access, if you don't spent it for the development of the game. This is just stupid and shows, that they obviously don't want to spent more manpower to the content creation, and maybe shift the money elsewhere. So therefore I rate, don't buy this game. You could be disapointed in the long run.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 19 Haziran 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiIts an interesting idea, but is pretty boring to play. While most base building games have you exploring the world, you'll spend most of your time in Raft simply looking at the ocean collecting random bits of crap that happen to float by you. And in that ceaseless deluge of flotsam, you will find planks, fronds, and bits of plastic which you will use to build a larger raft.Unfortunately that's pretty much the entire game in a nutshell. Ocasionally you'll flloat aimlessly to some tiny island where you can chop down a tree and collect a few flowers and some fruit. Then its back onto the Raft to collect more floating debris.What I will say for the game is that the building element is nicely done, even if its pretty rudimentary in design. Your raft can turn into a true ship, with multiple decks that basically auto-hauls trash out of the sea for you. But this is more like a sea-cleanup simulation than an actual game. Massive floatillas are only interesting if there is actual warfare, but that's not really a part of the gameplay here.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 18 ŞubatThis game is 20% fun and 80% tedious upkeep. So many cool ideas but you'll be spending hours running between boxes of misc crap to keep remaking tools and equipment due to gear that breaks faster than Breath of the Wild. The hunger and thirst rates are ridiculous and consume WAY too much of your time and effort to manage.Want to leave the raft to go on an adventure. Gotta fill up on water and food. Ah, gotta refill the water refiner but that needs another water container (yours is now full of fresh water). Either an extra cup/bottle takes up room in your small inventory or you need to fish it out of an inventory EVERY TIME you refill your water, lest there be none waiting for the next fill up. Want to eat? Well you need to catch fish with the most fragile fishing rod seen in a video game, then put it on the grill but you need to refill the planks and you better hope you didn't use all your planks while remaking your spear for the 100th time. Or maybe you plant seeds that either return 1 or 0 seeds when it bears fruit. That takes fresh water too, so you'll need to deal with water again, which is alright because by this point your thirst is back to where it started.This gets old FAST.Also regarding these awesome looking rafts -- I don't know why or how you'd find time and resources to build all those cool custom rafts when you have to spend so much of both tediously remaking your gear over and over, or repairing your raft from the shark constantly eating it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 11 Temmuz 2022Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiPicked it up with two friends - had to restart repeatedly due to glitches and fail-states (like the raft being destroyed by a hyper-aggressive shark five minutes into the game while we were still learning the most basic crafting recipes and controls together), and seemingly being irreplaceable even though it's just a few planks of wood.Had to continually google unexplained very basic features during the opening stages of a survival game under intense time-pressures - this is annoying if you can pause but it's game-breaking on a live multiplayer server.Quickly reached the point of realising the game is just unfinished by ordinary standards and only tolerable to a community who've come to expect survival games to be incredibly janky.We may have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unlucky with the number of bugs and problems we ran into around interaction, spawning, resource distribution etc, but we chose to refund before the hour was up.I'd love to have a solid survival game based chiefly around sailing/drifting, but this isn't it - barebones, janky, and poorly presented to new players.

"Yayınlanma: 18 Temmuz 2022I bought this game in early access, I loved the first few free builds that were on itch back in the day, it showed a lot of promise... The full game is good, the building system is really in-depth and you can make some pretty cool things. The story on the other hand, the concept is cool but the execution is all wrong.I played this game multiplayer with a friend of mine, he was the host. I'll admit that I don't have good internet, but my internet isn't *that* bad. However, this game has some very stupid bugs and glitches that made multiplayer frustrating.Later in the story there are a few ""boss"" like areas. These areas are awful, I wouldn't consider trying to do this game in hardcore, because these fights can be completely unfair and it's way to easy to get locked into an animation with an enemy or get hit away from the oxygen source and drown.I had to take several breaks to cool down from getting frustrated at how broken and unfair the game felt at times.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 21 Temmuz 2022I tried to like itI thought after leaving early access I might give it a chance. But it limited everything so hard, my fun limit is reached ...storyWe played 'til island 3 and the story ist good I guess. Nothing special so far, sometimes you also meet random NPCs who are super useless to the story I don't know why they are there.The playthrough is suprisingly fun, exploring the story islands take time so you don't rush through it. There are different story islands with different 'challenges' to master and some useful blueprints to find.Leaving early access just meant, they finished the storyline.survivalThey took it serious with survival. Really serious. We play on 'normal' difficulty and the frequenzy my char need to eat or drink is ridiculous. It is not fun to have to fish every 5 minutes because you are hungry the whole time. Same with water. Exploring (the story islands) becomes so annoying because you need (minimum) 2 bottles of water and at least 10 fish. Not to mention the way you get food. The standard fishing rod is broken after 8 fish. What is that? Any other way to get food? Well yes, but actually no. Mushrooms can only be found, potatoes and redbeets are getting eaten by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bird the whole time (even you have scarecrow) and give like 5% wow. The few animals you can barely find on islands give steaks, same goes to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bird and the shark. But that's it. And they give like 20%, like nothing.sharkYour 'main' problem should be the shark, but he is no problem at all. You don't even need armor to survive 4 attacks. The only problem is his hunger of raft. I don't know why this shark likes eating plastic and wooden planks but fine, go for it. While you fish the whole time and scare the bird, you also have to take care to the sharky. Because he also likes to eat every 5 minutes just like you. Annoying.buildingUhm, I'm really disappointed. The raft building is hardly limited. Just 2 different foundation forms and no diversity in decoration parts at all. (Yea, it's limited by the material you can get from the water but cmon). Everything is expensive to build, sharky eats it the whole time and you don't even get the time to build your raft. Less 'deco' objects, more diversity in shapes and it would be worth the material grind.No added elements 'til they left early access. Sad.Sadly, you cannot build anything on isands. I would have liked a summer house at the beach on an island, plant some trees and potatoes and just enjoy. But that's not possible.craftingCrafting is nice. You can craft every armor and weapon in your inventory (no workbench thanks) and material cost are mostly fine. The cooking/shake station is fun to use (although not worth at all).""Exploring""""Exploring"" because there is nothing to explore in this game. Every island looks exactly the same, no buildings or caves to explore. Just hop on it, chop the treees, gather some metal and copper and go. The sizes are also a joke. They could have done more. Much more if I compare it with the story islands ... but they didn't because reasons. I really thought ""yea just early access problems. They will add some new islands with stuff on it"" No. Just no.Underwater is nothing btw. Only the shark and water. Sad as well.mechanicsCombat is a joke. Clunky, broken hitboxes and just a few weapons without unique playstyles. Why did they release it like this? That's what early access stands for. Development. But they only developed the story. that' all. No bugs or hitboxes fixed and you can jump higher+wider with 30fps. What a joke. Big disappointment.game modes/difficultynormal is annoying and hard is a bit harder than normal. Because of the points above, I only can recommened the creative mode, deleting all the survival elements to really get the time to build your raft.But, for me, even creative mode doesn't make any fun because of the hard limited building elements.TL:DRThe game looks promising but everything is hardly limited. Story is fine and fun, but exploring normal islands is clearly disappointing because they are all the same without buildings/caves. Base building could be nice in creative mode only, but you have just 2 different element shapes and 385431 deco objects. False priorities in my opinion. The shark is no danger at all and the bird is just annoying without any reason to but him into the game, sry not sry. The only things you do the whole time in this game are: fishing, scare the bird, hit the shark, chop trees on islands, repeat. Oh, and you character is hungry/thirsty 24/7, but the food is bad. Crafting system is fine and fair at least.3/10",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 22 Ekim 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiNOT ENOUGH CONTENTThis game is too small, and until the developers make this into a bigger game, it is not worth $20 at allOther nit picks that I have with this game are...1) Early game collection of resources is hellish -- I don't mind a good grind, but for me, getting resources felt terrible2) Iron tools have too little durability -- It felt as if every time I made an iron tool after using it to its breaking point I would have less resources than when I made the tool3) Building system is annoying -- I like gravity in building games, but in raft, any kind of second story building is difficult to build without messing up the floor below with tons of columns4) The story was boring -- I don't mind puzzles in games, but when I have to walk back a forth on a huge island i feel like I'm pulling my hair out. Combined with the story being just alright made doing the story islands kinda boring.5) That's kinda it, everything else was specific for me -- like the slow walk when you run out of food/water (I managed that poorly and forgot to eat/drink a lot of the time)Stuff I liked about the game :)1) I really liked all of the nic-nacs that you can make and place, it made decorating really fun2) Art style of the game is nice3) Hanging out with a friend or two on a raft is fun4) Automating things in the late game was funMy overall review is to not get this game until they add more content, and not content like story, but content like new machines, tools, resources, and building options.If you can get this game for free or for like 10 bucks, sure give it a play, but for $20.... nah",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 8 Ağustos 2022Top four complaints about this game:Bizarrely inconsistent rules about how planting works. How do you get more potatoes? You plant a potato, obviously. How do you get more watermelons? Plant a watermelon? Don't be stupid, you need watermelonseeds, which of course you can't get from a watermelon. Obviously.A lot of unnecessarily punishing resource consumption mechanics. To make honey, you need a glass jar to put the honey in, which requires glass. Fine. Then when youusethe honey, the glass jar is gone forever. So you have to permanently consume glass to get honey.Some truly awful puzzles, theleastof which are the jumping puzzles.Weird, tricky multiplayer desync issues.Ultimately, I can forgive those problems. What really bugs me about this game is thateverythinghas durability, andyou can't repair items. You just have to use things until they break and disappear, and carry spares of everything around. Tremendously obnoxious.I'm gonna beat it anyways because suffering is still fun when you're suffering with friends, but there's better options out there in the genre.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 25 Mart 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI feel off the other reviews saying the game has been in early access for over 2 years is kind of stupid, as many games these days stay in early access so they can release a full game with all the content they want to fulfill in there eyes.Cons:>Game starts off slow and boring and takes hours especially as a new player, no in game guide or tips.>Combat sucks in the game, you can dodge every hit from any mob other then the mamma bear by simply jumping, running backwards, or straffing.>Distance rendering is also bad, you can barley see anywhere you go even with the binoculars, if it was stormy i can see why it would be hard to see around you. But mid day you can only see as far as the garbage spawns towards you.>Wind never changes even depending on the wind, weather, conditions it never changes making it harder to go the direction you want to move.>Story barley exist, for having over 2 years to work on the game and pushing the story in the trailer its very short. Took 1-2 hours to complete all the ""quests"" for yourself, most of it was just boating around and parkour. It took me around 10 hours to get set up enough to do any of it, but i was newer at the time.>When you die you cannot get your stuff back. Surrendering loses everything on you and cannot be obtained, only way to keep loot is if you have friends to play with and that's assuming everyone does.>The physics are pretty bad, spite saying that there are some good physics but the majority is very weak and lacking.>Islands do not have any type of respawn of anything, only thing that have respawns are the main quest island and the shipwreck where it keep spawning monsters every 2.5 minutes and can be farmed and abused.>dupping is easy and we have found glitches when with friends after being downed you can throw your friend off a small cliff then catch them mid air and bring them to a bed and they have perma fly mode active on any difficulty!Pros:>Graphics for the game is cartoony and pretty.>Could play this for many hours, different difficulties which render the threats harder, resources lessened, and hunger and thirst intake boosted hard making it a challenge.>Infinite world like minecraft different island spawns and different loot spawns, new animals, monsters, and a boss on main island which you can go to at anytime with the gps.>lots of different type of building styles and hidden ones too.>A shark to keep you on edge and watch over the boat more then watch over yourself.>Can play with up to 4 people, and the game is way better with friends.>There are mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ llamasI would recommend the game but it's depending on the games you like, i think the game has potential and i would play this every update that they bring, but currently i don't think it's worth the price its listed with the bugs, little physics, glitches, mechanics and short story with no meaning, wait for sale atleast if you want to try the game out.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiOk let me start of by saying that if you have friends to play this game with then I 100% recommend it. This game is so much better with even just 1 friend to play with. However if you are playing alone or do not have any friends that own the game like me, there is not much that you can do. Although this is just how I felt for the short time I played the game, you may feel different so you need to give it a try on your own. Overall, the game is well made, and has a great concept going for it. If you can find a friend or two to play the game with, this game easily has hours of fun for you and your friends. However if you are just looking for a game to play by yourself, its probably not the game for you.TL;DR: Its a great game if you have friends to play with, however if you are playing alone you may feel like its lacking in areas.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 Ocak 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game at its heart tends to be really boring, If your looking to live on a raft in the middle of the ocean, you would not expect constant harassment by a shark. When you start there is no tutorial either so you have no idea how to get food or purify your water. All of which will help assist in your death multitudes of times. It takes some time also to realize that your materials like rope can be made from Leaves. The water movement is also very poor, your raft will never drift in more than one current. If you know oceans you should know how currents should work which this game does not even try to copy. Your raft will never go between two crosscurrents.

"Yayınlanma: 20 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiInititally i recommended this game bk when I first bought it. But since they have changed it so it demands an internet connection to work properly. At one point u were forced to play with one on completely. This was not mentioned when I bought the game, I buy games where I can buy and dl them, and then play in single player offline mode. Not everyone wants to be exposed to wifry for x amount of hours just to play a game that has a single player mode and shouldnt need internet connection for that. The reply from the dev team, copied from another post:So here is the reply I just got. Not very happy about this RedBeet. What advantage do you gain by requiring me to be online while playing? I don't recall ever seeing this when I first purchased the game a year ago.Redbeet Interactive (Redbeet Interactive Support)Jun 21, 2022, 18:17 GMT+2Hi!Okey, I understand. However, unfortunately raft requires an internet connection to be played. Try removing the offline status and try again.Best regards,Redbeet Interactive.- This is utterly disgusting and shows lack of respect for ur buyers who just want to sit and enjoy a building and xploring game they bought on false pretenses.Now they have made it so u CAN play it without internet, but after having finished the game myself now and played it for 80 hours, I ca tell u that u can NOT progress in the story without internet, u WILL xperience lots and lots of bugs that will force u to do an alt f4 and lose save data, unless u play with internet on, or in my case get ur brain fried unecesarily by wifry. You wont be able to press any vending machines to get housing decorations to decorate ur home with and have fun with, unless u, in my case and most others who dont have cable access, fry ur brain with wireless radiation first. The 'some features wont work without an internet connection' will haunt u in ur sleep further in. Later added building items will cause this bug, like the automated anchor and engine controls. while u have that one installed, even going into ur chests can cause the bug and Ive lost so many hours worth of creations due to this.This is NO ok and I advise ppl not to support this type of thinkiing. This is done more and more intentionally, to get us all forced into the internet of things and fry our brains as much as posible.Not everyone can or want to do this. And if it is a req to need internet in SINGLE PLAYER, pls effing write it so we dont waste our time on ur game another time. we xpect internet to be a req in multiplayer, ofc, but for single player, no.

"Yayınlanma: 2 Temmuz 2022Full disclosure, this is definitely an ""I wish there was a neutral option"" kind of review. I enjoyed Raft through the first half of it. The building and creativity aspect is great, and it does a good initial job of sucking you into the world and getting you invested. By and large, it's well polished. I encountered a few bugs - glitching through the floor kind of things - but nothing that I'd say was game-breaking.I first picked up the game a bit over a year ago with my wife, and we played through about half of Tangaroa before we called it quits to wait for the final release. Now that that has come, and we've finished the game properly. And while Raft, at its core, has a good concept, the story overall feels disjointed. It's a series of islands that you go to to pick up the next piece of the story, and each one in and of itself is a separate segment of the game. To make matters worse, it feels like most of the really useful tools are pointless.We spent the entire game looking forward to things like the wind turbine, electric grill, and electric purifier, and by the time we got to them, we had only 1-2 islands left before we finished the game. There was nothing else to do, and those constructions were rendered pointless.So as I said - at its core, there's a good crafting/creativity kind of vibe here. If you're able and willing to give yourself goals, and build your raft up just for the sake or building it, then great - there's a bit too much waiting for my tastes, but you'll have fun. But I felt like I embarked on a journey I had no emotional attachment to, in a world where all the cool stuff I could get access to wouldn't be available until I had already finished. As a goal-oriented player, it definitely wasn't for me.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiGood idea, howoever, ive just fund out today that there are MANY identical games on the App store for apple. It kinda makes me want to return this game as the apps are free- and this game feels a little basic when compared to the free versions that do EXACTLY the same thing.Considerig these guy made scrap mechanic, theyve moved on too quickly and fallen down he stairs with this game, the idea is good, but unfortunately its a CLONE of about 5 games i can see in app store, and thats without scrolling down. The whole game, minus third person and a few other small details, is a copy... and will undoubtably slow progress of Scrap Mechanic like all the rest o the small personal changes theyve made.im unsure what to do with it, but im sure the developers will expand on what the apps have.

"Yayınlanma: 30 Kasım 2022CONS:There is no built in tutorial for this game, making it very hard and confusing to figure out.I only realized there was a STORY line when I had to google how to make the trash cubes for the trading post on the island I kept coming back to.The first 10 hours of game play I only managed to wander between the same 3 or 4 islands, quickly ruining the idea that islands might randomly spawn to be found and explored. So it is an ""open sandbox"" with specific areas only.I was building up my raft after the many and various shark attacks before noticing that my hook was dying and then I didn't have the resources to build another and kept dying trying to swim around and pick things up. Finally had to restart on easy mode to figure things out.I had to google more and more things to figure out how to play the game, and the shark is so annoying until you finally figure out how to get a bow to kill it. Even then, spending 5 minutes killing a shark to look for resources in the ocean without dying, only to have it spawn back a few minutes later is so frustrating.Oh and then there are big birds that will try to kill you too and they are even HARDER to kill. Great.Beware the Mama bear, the others are easy to kill. And if you happen to go to that island the same way I did, you wouldn't know that there is a way to avoid her.I didn't see Seaweed as a gatherable resource until I happened to have night fall when I was round the far side of the Trader island and then, everything glowed and was easy to see and find.The wind never actually changes directions, which was very frustrating when trying to figure out how to navigate by the receiver and what you need is directly opposite the wind. And then you don't find more resources either, because you are basically stuck fighting the wind and nothing happens. Have to go along the sides of a triangle to get to where you need to go for the story.Since I spent so much time building and improving my raft without knowing there was a plot, by the time I got an engine, it didn't work, because my raft was too big.Its not clear if you need to keep the blueprints you find after picking them up, so I had chests full of them. Same with the recipes, and you can't pin all the recipes up on the cooking stations. Only like 3 of the at a time.If you kill something but don't get to it fast enough it disappears, so all the arrows and resources are lost. When you have to fight off multiple pigs, this is super frustrating.Also I hate jumping puzzles and there are a few required places you have to jump jump jump to get through.I stopped playing the game when the raft kept turning itself in circles for no reason. No wind, no engines on. The radar clearly showed it constantly moving to the left. I saw several reports of this on reddit and steam, so its obviously an issue that never got fixed and was the final straw that caused me to stop playing the game.PROS:Once you learn a few things, its fun to kill the damned seagulls and cook them.Exploring an island for the first time can be a lot of fun.Its a neat idea and a different kind of survival/farming game, if you can stand all the bugs.I did play around 40 hours, so I gave it a good go, but the raft constantly turning killed it for me.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Kasım 2022Overall Rating: 5/10""Raft"" is growing sensation that continues to impress for a game that was essentially developed by 8 people and started as a school project.

However, objectively speaking, this game's experience is mediocre at best. It has a good few hours of solid fun for a group of friends, but ultimately falls short in ways that many other survival games just do it better.

For awhile I found myself constantly drinking salt water instead of pouring it into the thing, and I still constantly drop items by mistake.Keeping up with food/water and the shark eating the raft was fine at first, but it got pretty old pretty quickly, especially when coupled with having to stop frequently and re-make tools that have poor durability and break quickly.Overall the game just felt really repetitive and we got tired of it quickly. It needs a lot of tuning before I'd recommend it or really want to play again.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Temmuz 2022Look, I love this game. But I also have anxiety and I scare easily. Peaceful mode was incredible and afforded me the ability to have fun in this amazing, interesting world. However, with the most recent update that finished the story, I've had my wits scared out of me several times by attacking mobs. I understand some things are necessary for the story -- but some things aren't. Some things are just there to make the game more difficult, more challenging. That may be fun for a lot of people. But when you have a peaceful mode in a game, it's expected to be PEACEFUL.I'll keep playing, but until these things change to match the ""peaceful"" label, I can't finish the story myself. It causes me too much stress. To anyone like me, I can't recommend the game, not fully. To people who love these challenges, get the game -- it IS a great game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 19 Temmuz 2022After playing before the full release, it ended uneventful and my friends and I were so excited for the full release in hopes of so much more. We were obsessed!

"Yayınlanma: 15 Temmuz 2022This game was super fun with friends but ultimately at the end it left this kind of unfinished emptiness, like we didn't get to do what we originally we're trying to accomplish and it left a sour taste in my mouth after finishing",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 8 Temmuz 2022This game is the most lazy survival game I've ever played, the ending is a stupid ass slide-show that leaves you majorly disappointed and enraged at the developers. The people literally give you food and a vending machine for beating the final boss. On top of the stupid ending the villain is defeated in the most lazy way possible and he cannot be killed.Aside from the lazy and poorly put together story there are also major underlying problems that make this game worse than its genre competitors.Titanium is gathered in overly difficult ways that don't make any sense. What was the point of adding it if it is so rare to come by and if everything that requires it needs so much of it. Like yeah game, I would love to get all these new tools and gadgets but how to I get titanium in bulk? Fish for 5 hours just so a vendor can sell me three per island, no thanks. Search up youtube videos so I can find the secrete stashes that I would've never found by myself; sure that seems like a lazy way to implement this, ""thumbs up"". You guys could've at least given us a bunch of titanium for the ending instead of a dumbass farmers market, a slide show with narration, and npc that have ungrateful and clueless dialogue.The rhino shark boss fight was better and more difficult than the alpha hyena and even it wasn't that good. Seriously the boss loot is so underwhelming and could be better design by anyone else.The only fun lore islands were the dome and the snow island. It was smart to add a mode of transportation on the snow island but every other lore island just seems like a chore to run around a do anything.All in all, this game is so lazy and there is much more to complain about but I found myself the most infuriated by the ending of the game and by how stupid it is the get titanium. This game is more ♥♥♥♥ than anything else I've ever played and I was more satisfied uninstalling the game and writing this review than beating the game itself.4/10",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Temmuz 2022It's a game like this that makes me really wish Steam had more options than ""Yes"" and ""No"" recommendations.I would absolutely like to state first and foremost that Raft is a great spin on the standard crafting/survival game. The game initially is also very well thought-out: you are on a raft, and must collect resources (basically garbage) to improve your raft and survive. Without spoiling too much, massive climate change has changed the world and that's why garbage is so plentiful wherever you sail. You really feel like a survivor in a dystopian future that also feels very idyllic. The contrast is nice, and the available resources, initially, don't distract from the feeling of scavenging for supplies that many other games get very wrong.What the game does not do very well is incorporating the story sections. The story sections are inherently interesting but have unfortunately been made slightly tedious at best, and totally obnoxious at its worst. The game does not need platforming sections. The game does not need heavy combat sections. The game does not need poorly executed environmental puzzles. These feel tacked on so they could release a ""full product"" as opposed to thoughtfully integrated elements that work with the existing gameplay and world-building. I would say these feel like a ""second draft"" when, with some more time, (maybe a ""fourth draft""), it could really be incredible to experience the story sections.Developers, please do not mistake me when i say: I REALLY WANTED TO ENJOY THE STORY SECTIONS.I would say I enjoyed my time in Raft up until the third story section and then you just kind of advance the story until the end. After that there really isn't much of a game outside of developing your raft.Would I recommend the whole game as it exists right now on full release? I would say a very hesitant no, because the foundation of this game is so good and well thought-out. I just wish the game after the first 7 - 10 hours had as much thought put into it as the first 7 - 10.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 Temmuz 2022Generally this is a recommend from me but with massive minuses for some parts of the game.The base game for this is a fine enough open world crafter with fun progression and new things to see, I have some nit picks about the some of the mechanics such as moving at a snails pace if your food or water meter drops too low and the combat for the most part being brain dead easy but most of this is ignorable and doesn't detract too much from the overall game.However where this game breaks down is every single story line island. The first few story islands you come across are mostly boring and tedious as you search around for whatever treasure hunt piece you need to progress to the next story, they're inoffensive but horribly dull but tolerable because you get shiny new blue prints to get progress. And then you get to the final chapter islands and every single one of them is a test of patience and endurance as it feels like you're almost physically fighting the level designer.There's literally a puzzle where they force you into a room of radiation with a hazmat suit while you're trying to figure out the puzzle, this wouldn't be so bad except the hazmat suit has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ timer which means you'll be darting in and out of the room while trying to figure out the stupid puzzle. The radiation can't even really kill you it's so slow so there's absolutely no risk and all it adds is tedium.Apart from the tedious bosses there's also the infamous platforming sections which you've probably already seen people mention but needless all you really need to know is that its first person platforming with really poor collision. Lastly we get to the bosses which are both tediously long and extremely easy. The last boss is just a giant health sponge that you hit over and over till it dies, it has the same boring easy combat as all the other enemies except that it occasionally does a special move that's hard to dodge, but you have 3 healing salves you'll probably be able to kill it easily.I really wish they had come up with something better for the story islands or just a better way to add progression into the game that would revolve far more about staying on your raft rather than doing tedious busy work.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 Temmuz 2022Raft had the potential to tell an incredible story of Climate change and protecting the earth we live in. Instead the story is something out of a kids novel, while the areas and puzzles were fun enough the story up until the final part of the chapter was engaging! While not spoiling anything Raft has the worst if not most disappointing ending story wise in any game ive come across. Voice acting was good atmosphere was pretty good. But the ending was actually the worst in any game I have ever played in my life-If you play with friends the games fun enough otherwise I do not recommend.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 22 Haziran 2022This game centers around a unique series of gameplay mechanics that seem so cool and unique at first but after a few hours you realize why this hasn't been attempted before. It is one of the most boring experiences I have ever had with a game even playing with friends wasn't enough to keep me from actually falling asleep at times. The game tries to keep you engaged by making your food and water meters deplete quickly so that you have to always be fishing, gathering materials, building, and repeating or die. It's a babysitting game with nice set dressing. I'd recommend trying it as it's clearly someone's game but if you don't like the gameplay experience of the first hour to two hours, don't bother playing it because the entire game is that gameplay experience.",N/A

The waves make it impossible to grab items at times they go straight through the hook.

"Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiFrom what I'm gathering, there's a bunch of updates going into this game, and the devs are active, which is great.  But why is development going towards expanding the game when it still has quality of life/AI issues?  The aggressive animals are impossible to avoid, and dying early on is straight up ruthless!  The shark is constantly surrounding your raft, which doesn't make sense for a real shark to do.  Maybe have it out of sight most of the time, occasionally popping up to reveal it's presence.  I can tell the shark is on a timer between attacks, since it attacks with the same frequency.  I think it would make sense if it attacked in bursts so you were forced to focus your attention on it, and when the shark has had enough it would leave you alone for a long time.  Seagulls are annoying and also attack with the same frequency, although I do love how they aren't eating your food, but instead bash their heads into your crops like they have some insane personal issues with farming.  That's just hilarious.  Boars DO NOT leave you alone once they're aggro'd, they were following me all around an island at a pace always faster than me, coupled with the bird dropping rocks on my head I couldn't get a breather to craft a spear.  Birds dropping rocks, the size of which would be pretty heavy for a human to lug around, on your head?  That's just stupid.Your inventory doesn't drop when you die (normal mode).  Honestly it seemed very forgiving that I could immediately spawn after death.  But I died near my raft and everything I had was gone.  I mean, it makes sense that there should be some punishment for not being better than the boar.  I guess I had fully expected a body or chest to be left behind.  Perhaps I'm spoiled from other survival games.Why do I need to smash my hook on rocks and other small objects to pick them up?  If I can break rocks with a plastic hook, why can't I also use my tools to fend off animals when my spear breaks and I'm out of resources?  Let me punch the shark, for crying out loud.  You know what I would do?  jab it in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eye or punch it in the nose.  They hate that apparantly.  Also, if I actually had to fight for my survival against a shark, I would be stabbing the ♥♥♥♥ out of it really fast, not prodding at it like I was carefully creating a work of art with some sort of sculpting tool or something.Spending a resource on research?  That was weird, considering it's for gaining knowledge on HOW to make it, but not actually gaining anything out of it.  Seems like I should be able to keep the items.  I also find it odd that I'm informed of what I need for researching objects, but I'm not allowed to make them until I researched them?  Perhaps let me put the resources together on the research bench, research it and simultaneously get the item (the game Don't Starve comes to mind)  I don't know, maybe I'm being nitpicky.Here's another gripe.  I built my raft out long width-wise with some nets to have a wider catching range.  At first I realized my raft wouldn't turn under my own influence, so I had the impression rafts didn't turn.  I was starting to catch more resources.  Then I came upon an island.  Raft nudges on island.  Raft SLOWLY turns diagonal.  Now my nets aren't covering as much area.  I can't push my raft around manually.  I have to direct raft into island a certain way to turn it back, but it's cumbersome and doesn't behave the way you would expect it to.This game is definitely early access, but why is the development focus on expanding on content?  It still seems to have serious quality of life problems that need work first.  I am no stranger to survival games and understand the standards of resource gathering and basebuilding, but after 6 hours of play I am still unable to stabilize my sustainment.  Heck, I can barely survive.I do think this game has potential, and I'd like to see where it goes, though if you've been in early access since, what, 2018, and you're still not done, I'm not holding my breath.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiAs much as the game feels fun to play early on, it quickly becomes boring.At first you explore the environment as you travel and discover different materials and blueprints. Some you get randomly from chests and barrels, some you get in a more scripted way.Once you build the antenna and the radio, here is when the game starts to feel a bit boring. You travel to yet another island, that looks differnet and has some sequence of things you need to complete, but it is pretty much empty. No characters, the story is somehere on the notes where there is a bunch of characters who you don't care and don't see, you just see their names and then it's up to you to chain them to notes and events described. And it makes this game feel boring and silent. Because then you get the new coordinates and you travel through the same area, not discovering anything new anymore on the way, only to reach another island, where you have to spend hours exploring and finding notes to get some new blueprints that you'll need to reach another island.And so it repeats and goes on and on. Some islands are pretty small in size, some are pretty much a set of copy pasted same models, containing same items in the same places. So you go get several of them and then you simply get enough of it and don't want to go there anymore, but you have to if you want to find notes. So it feels like a huge chore just to be done with the island and get some new blueprints.And this makes me question about the engagement - it's fun at the start, but then in order to get one or two new blueprints, you have to spend hours to reach some island and explore it. And on the way you get nothing new at all and just have to repeat the same thing - get water, get food, smelt ores.Unfortuantely to me it felt really boring. This game requires better progression and more content on the way.I tried to reach the game to it's current end, but today I found out that almost 2 hours of my save files are marked as ""Error"" and hence I couldn't get back to the same place I ended the game last time and I don't want to spend another 1.5 hours doing the chores only to get some ore to build some new item that I will use once or twice on the way.",N/A

All this combined and the weather really sets the mood for this game and the survival aspect. However, after awhile the game became very repetitive and kind of boring. I wish there would be more challenging aspects in the game. The shark is very predictable, always does the same thing. For an example I kinda wish you could be in the water for awhile before the predictable shark appears. And I mean.., there are other things in the ocean than sharks that are dangerous.On a final note I do see the potential in this game, but I won't be playing it for some time.

"Yayınlanma: 18 Mart 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiA heavily unbalanced (combat, resources, nutrition etc), tediously repetitive and boring game that is even worse in singleplayer.The stat gains for rarer resources are laughable, completely negate'able.You can't repair any tools: Bit of an oversight here no?The shark mercilessly attacks your boat constantly like clockwork until you rage and mod the game so it's sleeping all the time, regardless of how much you feed it.Creature AI is fairly basic, to make up for this, take a few weapons with you, because it doesn't matter if you stab it in the most dangerous of places, it'll take multiple weapons to bring it down, even if it was made from space-age moon metals.What's the point in a scarecrow if the seagulls just ignore it?Resource costs for upgrades are a bit silly, high tier metal for storage?My character drinks so often, she has water intoxication and was rushed to Accident and Emergency.Staring out at the ocean I assume short of islands and the occasional abandoned raft etc, nothing else 'at all' exists: No rainbows, no real weather events (barely visible rain), no stars, no jumping fish, no dolphins, no kraken, no orca's to harass you as much as the shark...? Pirates? Whales?Equally as varied, fishing seems to be the same 10 items with no regional variation and is exceptionally unchallenged, just click when the line tugs, don't even need to be watching it.When stuff does get dangerous, it's made 100x more difficult by the unrealistically fast draining of your food/water, you don't need to carry one bottle around if you find say, the large island with the antenna area, you have to carry an inventory full, on top of food, emergency supplies and having space to actually loot something.

I play single-player, peaceful mode and it's so relaxing to spend the evening alone with an endless ocean.""With the new update, I can no longer stand by those words. The story progression was initially very fun, but the longer into the story you get the more high-reflex platforming puzzles you get, with eventually unskippable bossfights.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Ocak 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI like this.... chill out, relax entertainment ... not a game to be honest. You build a raft, sharks eats it, you kill shark, repair, build, shark eats it, kill shark, repair, build furhter....There is nothing here that I would really call a game, just grinding stuff to improve your raft, but somehow it is for me satisfying and most important, relaxing. Do not look for purpose, achieving something, so far this game does not provide this in my opinion. Like the small japanese sand garden on you table, combing the sand for relaxing, not to achieve some challenging target.Update:After adding the BigShip to explore, I am disappointed. Go to floor 5 to pick up key for door on floor 1, there pick item to open something on floor 6, than take that to open item on floor 1.... Is extremely lazy ""prolong the gameplay"" ever.

The tech tree is very small and after you build everything you basically drift around aimlessly catching animals for fun.Would I recommend this game in its current state?

The amount of content is extremely lacking, and I would have had no issue with it if the game was about 1/4 of the price. However to pay roughly $20 dollars for a game that has extremely little content to it feels a bit like a rip off.One quick way to improve the game (especially the multiplayer experience) would be to increase the difficultly of the shark. It was far too easy for the 4 of us to kill the shark, and then another shark wouldn't come until we reload the game. I would suggest adding more sharks that slowly increase in number as the game goes on. This would make it feel more like a survival than it currently does.As a base game, Raft has a lot of potential, I just hope the dev's are planning more content / different play modes etc. It is really lacking in this department currently.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game started out good with lots of potential, but bad performance and an already cancerous community make it not worthwile.It is easily possible that you will be unable to run this game from one day to another just because of an aesthetic patch. A hotfix post patch adresses mostly other bugs and aesthetics as well, while people with reasonably powerful gaming PCs in the forum report the game being unplayable because of bad fps, even though they are  even above recommended specs. Reaction of the devs is to say ""E-mail us"". Yes, it is early access, but performance issues not being adressed/expecting people to help you troubleshoot a broken product is... utopian, imo.The community is a joke. How dare you criticising a game?Be prepared to be showered with BS remarks and unhelpful comments if you dare ask any actually technical stuff in any group or just point out any issue. Yes, even after having helped people for weeks and commented workarounds and other stuff to help. Admins don't give a second thought and tell you to ""be friendly"" while you get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and keep pointing out that people are not even understanding the problem.Pick it up on sale IF you have other people to play with, but don't go as far to pay full price for it and even then be prepared that some gamebreaking bugs or performance issues will persist for weeks and months at a time, keeping you from playing. Also the fact that it is getting mixed reviews post what is the so far largest content patch should give you a reasonable amount of ideas in which direction this game is going and I can't really recommend to pick it up right now due to all these reasons.Frankly, there are other good early access titles that don't leave you ""stranded"" for weeks at a time, with communities that actually are not  cancerous bags of anti-technical witless trolls.______________Months after upper review the game runs even worse, even after the devs claim to have done a lot of optimisation. This turned garbage pretty fast.______________Edit: Over a year now and I came back to this game. Wow. It is even worse now. More grind, tools degrade a lot faster, for some reasons islands can only be spotted on the horizon by not looking directly at them (lol, wtf?) and hunger and thirst go down a lot faster while food provides a lot less sustenance altogether. A shark steak that provided >40% sustenance a year ago is now somewhere around 30%. Stay away from this._______________Edit: Yeah, tried it again. It's horrible. To see how little the devs actually added is laughable and by now I am convinced they are amateurs. The game has nothing to offer but tedium, the core gameplay is so uncreative and basic for a survival game, it's a joke. I really wonder what the actual hell they did for a year. Raft, the more often I give it a chance, the more it seems that it is creatively bankrupt. Every survival game has an element of grind, but Raft offers nothing else. Wonky, buggy and tedious, with almost nothing to show for the time in early access (over two years now) is the nicest thing I can say about it.The only upside, the game seems a lot more stable in terms of performance now, but given how long that was a grievance by quite a lot of people, I have to chuckle about calling this something positive.I am really reaching for the positives here.It CAN undeniably be fun, only not in the way it was envisioned to be played by its creators, which says quite a lot about the people behind this project. Buy at your own risk, and never do so at full price.The game is still more resource intensive than Vermintide 2 on highest details. Ah, this is hilarious.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 27 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiFirst of all I would like to make it clear that this game is beautiful and has a huge amount of potential even in a genre that is becoming over-saturated. The concept is intriguing, the UI is streamlined and easy to ""read"", and what crafting I was able to do was nicely streamlined though some multi-step things, such as purifying water, could use a little more guidance.That said, I can't recommend this game right now UNLESS you are absolutely going to play with friends. While technically one can play solo the game seems balanced to play with at least one other person. Even on an ""easy"" ocean I was hard pressed to juggle finding enough food, purifying water, and keeping my raft intact even when I was lucky enough to gather food on islands or from barrels. And since every game is considered multiplayer even if it is just a single player once you die your character is left waiting for a revive - which means you must manually quit the game and start a new world. Ideally the game would recognize that you're alone and ask if you want to restart.In the face of continued frustration playing solo and no immediate potential that any of my friends would pick it up I've requested a refund for now. If a true and balanced solo mode is introduced then I may consider picking it up again.If you have friends that play or want to play or you are social enough to join a random group you will likely have better luck than I did.Have fun!",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2022I loved this game. Really did. It was fun especially with friends and could be pretty easy going. A nice game to relax and just have fun while surviving. However, 1.0 has completely made this game unplayable. Being forced to be online is annoying but I can deal with it. What makes this unplayable is the game turning computers into furnaces. I have an RTX2070, i7-9700k, 48gb ram, 750w corsair power supply with 3 strong fans, multiple vents for air, and liquid cooling. This game, for whatever reason since this update, overheated my PC and forced it to shut down. My friends also complained of the game melting their PCs as well and we didn't even play for very long. I cannot recommend this game until this is fixed. Never had an issue before. Beat chapter 2 previously with no problems but 1.0 has done something wrong.

Its okay for late game and you do have to find it but we never had to collect wood again.And my other problem is the story, its weird and poorly made. And finally: the combat is clunky.

"Yayınlanma: 31 Aralık 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiit could be a great game, but i think it has some small but really important problems.a good game doesn't make players do repetitive tasks too many times. or at least it gives players a chance to automate those tasks. especially in crafting games, players should be able to craft something that automates those tasks, so that players can move on. for example collecting nets in this game are great. they give you an opportunity to automate the task of collecting garbage, which is normally boring after some time.but lets say you want to collect some clay underwater. first, you need to kill that shark. after you kill it (takes 5-10 mins) the new shark comes just after 3.5 minutes!! come on, devs! really?? you can collect just a little in that 3.5 minutes, then you need to do that about 10 times to get enough items to make a smelter. you also need to go find another island every 2 times, because the clay reserves deplete pretty fast. this whole collecting clay process needs to be WAY faster.also weapons and armor. it is really hard to make even the simplest armor in the game. and armors don't really help much. with the best armor set, you get something like 30 percent protection from damage. then why should we bother to make armor?weapons: there are basically 3 melee weapons with the damages 1, 2 and 3. and there is only one bow. the game needs more than this, come on.the game is still in early access. i would love to see this game getting better, i will gladly change my review if it does.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 18 Temmuz 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe concept is great. You flow through the open ocean on four blocks and scavenge resources that come your way to turn that raft into a true sea-worthy vessel. It's the concept itself that compelled me to purchase this game. But the execution is why I refunded it with such little play time.From the start the repetitive nature of this game quickly sinks in. You spend a few minutes throwing a hook to get resources that are just out of grabbing reach. You then exchange plastic, plants or wood for something you need. Maybe another hook, maybe a water purification station. Then you repeat the process again. Hook the unrealistic amount of debris randomly flowing through the waters in your direction. Make something that might be useful, the shark attacks your boat. You fight it off, you scavenge some more. Maybe an Island appears. You hop on it to grab some free food and maybe a seed. You hop back on your boat.You repeat infinitely...The game had so much potential but for the most part this game is just you crouching and picking up debris that come your way, or using a hook to drag them in and using those resources to make something that might be useful in prolonging that gameplay loop.It's not fun...

"Yayınlanma: 26 Kasım 2022I really want to love this game. It has most of what it needs to be an excellent game. It has the potential to be everything from a cozy builder to a brutally challenging survival game. Unfortunately, it suffers from too many problems to recommend it.The biggest problem is that the game has been filled with pointless make-work. You will die if you do not eat many times per day. You will die if you do not drink water many times per day. Obviously, survival is a big part of a survival game, but it should be a challenge, not just a tedious waste of time that makes it difficult to find enough time to play the enjoyable parts of the game. This stuff isn't fun. It's not difficult. It's not a challenge. You can't do better or worse at it or get better with practice. It's just annoying, pointless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that completely dominates the gameplay loop and which you can never automate away. Imagine having to go into a nested menu and press a button to breathe every 10 seconds or die. Dial it back about one notch, and that's this game.Here's how it works when the game starts: you won't be able to craft the tools needed to eat or drink until you've collected a lot of materials. While you're working on that, you will quickly begin to die. Once you have the materials to make a fishing rod, the raw fish available to you will only buy you about 2 minutes of gameplay per fish, and it harms your thirst level. You'll need to distill some saltwater--assuming you're lucky enough to find the materials you need--so you can replenish your thirst. You'll probably spend several days doing nothing but fishing, cooking, and purifying water non-stop simply to build your hunger and thirst levels back up. Every time you spend 5 minutes doing something like building or exploring an island, you'll have to repeat the process because you'll be nearly dead again.The inventory is so crippled at the beginning of the game that you will be forced to throw out valuable resources constantly just so you can catch a fish to avoid dying of hunger. The inventory capacity is so small that you cannot even carry one each of the critical crafting materials, the minimum set of tools to survive, and one item of food. Stack sizes are tiny, just to make sure you're forced to constantly discard resources and then run out later. Storage containers are also very small. The game will not automatically combine stacks and has no sorting feature at all. It's impossible to keep your inventory organized because the game treats the hotbar as if it were ordinary inventory slots. As a result of all these design decisions, you're forced to spend frustrating amounts of time micromanaging your inventory and storage. The game doesn't pause while doing any of this, so while you're trying to do the work a decent inventory system would have done for you, you're starving and dying of thirst and the shark is eating your raft.Tools are so weak that you have to rebuild them after a few minutes of use, and you have to use (and damage) your tools to do everything, including picking up loose rocks and sand. You won't have any inventory space available for extra tools when the game starts, either. Only in the very endgame will you find a recipe to make a backpack that increases your inventory to a size where you won't be constantly having to move items in and out of storage based on which task you're doing. Because you have to constantly switch between maintaining your body, maintaining your crops, maintaining your raft, and exploring, you will spend most of your time doing this.Eventually, you learn enough crafting recipes and find enough resources to make some better quality tools and food. That makes these tasks less of a burden. Can you finally take a break and enjoy how beautiful the game is? Nope. At that point, the gameplay shifts to constantly running around transferring items through multiple stages of manufacturing, feeding fuel into things powered by fire, making and replacing batteries for electric items. Almost nothing can be automated.The UI is janky, and out of the box it suffers from major problems like the build windows overlapping the inventory window. The build menus are disorganized and the categories of many items (particularly ones important to new players) just don't make sense. While you're searching around the build tree to find the thing you know you need, you will die of starvation or thirst.The combat system is tolerable, but it's laggy and never really fun.To add to the frustration, the game doesn't tell you anything. You'll have to figure all of this out on your own. The most helpful information it provides is in the little tips it shows while loading; these actually have many critically important bits of advice, but you won't see them all until you've restarted the game 20 or 30 times. I cannot imagine why there isn't a tutorial tip system that provides the same information when it's relevant.There are mods to fix many of the issues I described, but they inevitably leave the game feeling a bit empty, because it has been built around all the pointless work. It's a shame, because the story and the exploration in the game is great fun.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Temmuz 2022This was such a fun promising thing at the start, and building a raft is pretty fun.It started out as a survival game, that both my wife and I loved,Now I am writing this review, as I am waiting for her to platform a super annoying part, with dreadful inaccurate mechanics.The last few islands don't have the survivor feel anymore. It feels like the devs crammed all the puzzles and useless time wasters to pad the game time. And the final boss and the story is just garbage.Instead of telling passive stories of the dead and gone world, the game tries to narrate it to you at every possible corner. And it fails miserably.It mostly tells instead of shows, and the whole world feels empty and lifeless.The diving mechanics are left as an afterthought, in a world that is 99% water. It consists of diving a bit around the islands and hitting stuff with your hook. A missed opportunity to tell a story of cities drowned, and hardships that come with a global flood.No upgrades are later needed to use in the game, as you can beat the entirety of the game in less than 10h, even if you take it slow, and build up your raft to max upgrades. (We played every update and I managed to squeeze 50h out of it, as we were restarting every time full of hope to see new things)It feels like a very junior Dev teams work.The game has forgotten what it started out as,I would not recommendI wish I wasn't annoyed by this game",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2022One of these games, that after all these years in EA you get the feel of ""Well, seems like they just wanted to finish it finally without making it good"".Weird mechanics, bad hit boxes, input delay of doom. And on top of it they converted it in some kind of bad plattform jump and run game.Not sure whats up with the voice acting either, sometimes it sounds like people with bad accent reading a weird script without emotions, sometimes it just sounds like a crazy AI talking, the Humor feels shallow and forced but that may be a personal taste. The Story is somewhat okayish, but nothing special.They should have focused on the scavanging and survival part, and (a common point of survival games) why the heck the protagonist has to eat like 5 whole sharks a day?! The food consumption is crazy. I can somewhat understand the water need, but food...even on easy mode, it's just weird.... (yes i know, well prepared food lasts longer)It might be easier with a group, but alone you spend a lot of time just micro managing everything.And last but not least, as a personal matter, a point that really annoys me...Who the heck had the idea of making that stupid windmill jump and run in Utopia... yeah, I'm honest, I'm very bad at jump and run games, but i tried this windmill stuff in 1st person and got pushed off so many times... so i switched to 3rd person, and...they push you of even if they don't hit you, they just have some kind of crazy hit box that pushes you without even touching you.Conclusion:If you are looking for a ""post apocalyptic"" waterworld like game, with focus on scavanging and survival, and some nice raft building, well... don't buy it.If you are looking for some Super Mario Plattformer and want to have fun with friends, some easy survival mechanics (easy if you have fun at micro management) and a lot of ocean cleaning, well, this one is the right game for you!",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 18 Temmuz 2022A mostly fun game completely ruined by frustrating jumping puzzles paired with an awful, janky jumping system that suffers from lag in multiplayer.Also, there is no save system. It's 2022 and someone created a game that can't be saved.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022It is beyond me why the reviews are so positive for this game. The game itself is a chore, with many nonsensical design choices. The world revolving around your raft is just bizarre, but I was willing to go through with it. The raft physics and collection is bugged. For example you can only collect the materials on the seafloor, if the game recognises you as swimming, even if you are standing on top of it with your hook. Casting your hook to collect materials when the ocean is wavy makes your hook float in the air without snagging anything. The melee combat is utterly terrible, with your wooden spear having the range of a toothpick. Hit a goat 20 times to kill it with my terrible spear, while it kept moving through me as apparently my character has no collision, only to see that you cannot harvest it for its flesh. Did your spear break when stabbing a shark? No worries, you have a metal hatchet right? Wrong. Those can only be used for cutting trees lol. Swapping between your hook and other weapons bugs them out, forcing you to swap again for them to be usable again. Truly astounding how there are many great survival games on the market, and the developers still managed to get no inspiration.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022I've played a lot of raft and it's not a ""bad"" game, but sadly I can't recommend it over the other similar survival/builders. They have put, in my view, way way too much time into a story mode that is fetch and carry with some random annoying boss fights that are only difficult because of how janky the controls/engine are with zero replayablity.Why not focus updates on making better multiplayer, such as multiple rafts, combat or mapping? The game can look great but weather is so dull, why no giant storms that smash you to bits or regions such as warm and hot so you have to actively figure out where to sail and there are consequences of doing so?So much potential wasted by devs focusing on single player story instead of craft, PVE & PVP.",N/A

In this speed of updating story, a chapter or chapters will come very slowly and the game will be waiting in the corner of your Steam library until that happens. Not just a problem of updating story chapters, but I believe there is no point of continuing game after story. There should be some interesting contents that are endless or close to endless.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhat is it with sea based games having little to no content? This game is overrated, it's as simple as that.If you were to play this on your own, you'd probably get about 2-3 hours of fun out of it.I recommend that you only play this with friends, as it can only be enjoyable with them. It's a fun game overall and has a lot of potential, however, after around 10 hours of play time, you won't have a reason to keep playing.My main complaint is that this game is so empty. As wide as an ocean as deep as a puddle describes this game perfectly. I know it's in early access, but I've played a lot of early access games with way more content than this. The story isn't attractive, there are a few neat things here and there, like I enjoy the cooking system, but in just a few hours we already had every item in the game (excluding the machete). You want to explore the 'vast' ocean? You can for just about 2-3 hours until you've seen it all, almost all the islands you will find are the same as one you saw before.As well as that the game is just really buggy and its hard to tell if it's part of the game design. When fishing, you can quite literally fish anywhere. On solid ground you can fish, on your raft you don't even need to use the sea, it just phases through the ground. This game greatly breaks any immersion you had as whilst sailing with your raft, your raft is constantly overflowed with water clipping through your floors.The enemies in this game are more annoying than difficult. There's a bird that will spawn on every large island and will drop homing rocks at your head, even if you dodge it, its like a grenade and will 90% of the time still hit you. Warthogs, if they ram you to a cliff edge or just the edge of a hill, you will not fall down it, instead you will be frozen in place in an infinite loop until the bird slowly kills you with its grenades. Don't even get me started on the shark, if you're alone this is the thing that ruins your experience as you constantly have to look out for it damaging your raft, if not careful it can destroy hours of work because you didn't hear it.The game feels more like work than a game, which I don't mind too much, but you don't have any time to take in the exploration feel and the feeling of sailing the seas as you constantly have to do a mix of management, shark killing, cooking, purification, smelting etc. this is not helped by the fact that the food and water bars empty in minutes. (unless with friends, but it still feels like a job)I also never expected to play a game where the most valuable resource by far is wood, not exactly a bad thing, but there aren't really any other valuable materials except maybe scrap and metal.So once again this is a game only playable with friends. This game is not worth *£15* at all, it has the content of a free to play game.I did still have a lot of fun at times in this game, but any game is fun when you play with friends.I really hope and will come back to the game once it has more content, because right now its just too bare.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ağustos 2020As several others have pointed out before, the constant struggle to get food, purify water, and build becomes highly repetitive and annoying.

"Yayınlanma: 31 Ağustos 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhile this is a cool and unique concept for a game, and is fun to play at first, I will not recommend that people buy the game in its current early access state, as it is very short and lacks content. I purchased the game 3 months ago and played through the game in roughly 4 hours. Since then I have been waiting for the developers to add more playable content to make the game worth returning to. Checking every few weeks, they have worked some on the game, adding minor features and items such the the ability to crouch, new paint colours, hunting bow and technical improvements to the engine itself. But the world is still the same with nothing more to explore after 4 those hours.Their priorities seem to be on getting the basics in place before adding more content, which is fine considering the game is early access, but at its current short play time and price tag, and with no new content added for 3 months I recommend that people wait until the devs add more content to the game. While the developers may seem like they are involving the community in the direction the game should take, running surveys and announcing features planned for the future, so far these features have only been promises and concept artwork without delivery.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 28 Temmuz 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiReview for v5:While this is a fun game, for about an hour (that's when you've played all of it), it feels like it's lacklusting in several ways.First of all, what's with the islands? They're tiny. It doesn't feel rewarding to find them. While I know there's bigger islands in development, I'm still waiting to see that with my own two eyes, and the current patch makes them feel insignificant.Second of all, because of the way the islands feel, the gameplay feels very linear. You just sail and sail and sail. I really liked the game for the first few hours, but quickly grew tired because of the repetetive gameplay pattern.Also, the raft feels impossible to get back on if you fall off. Seems like the hitbox is a bit off, which makes you just hit an invisible wall whenever you try to jump back on.I hope to see some further development of the game improve it, because the visuals are just stunning. As for now, I wouldn't recommend it, but that may change with the next patches.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 25 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiOh boy there are a lot of issues with this gameWhen you play it on normal you have to eat and drink every 5 min as the food or water barerly fills you up and the full bar depletes in about a day. At the same time you also have to craft a new fishing rod after using it like six times and either craft a spear to get the shark from destroying your raft or build that part again.Those are the issues that make the game tedious as it isn´t really about survival when 24/7 plastic, wood, barrels and plants drift alongside your boat giving you all the resources you ever need but you just have to reuse them for new fishing rods and raft foundation and so on all the time.This is further enhanced by mainly balance issues:-Shark always there and respawns shortly after he is killed-Fixing your raft isnt cheaper then building that part new-Planting fruits/veggies takes forever uses fresh water and still fills less then the fishes you catch-In multiplayer the starting raft is too small (although it can easily be expanded)-Crafted items are either unbreakable or last too shortIf you play this game I recommend setting it to easy so that food/water fills the bar more and you don´t have to worry about the artifical ""difficulty"" but then you will still run into a problem and that is not encountering islands to get your metals and other stuff from or that you don´t have any luck with blueprints leaving you waiting for hours on the raft with nothing to do.This would have been better as a pure exploration game with the ""survival"" parts being kept at a bare minimum.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Temmuz 2022For a game called ""Raft,"" you sure don't spend a whole lot of time there.When you're actuallyon the raft,Raft is pretty good. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the game is spent wandering aimlessly around set piece environments that are way too large, with way too many enemies that are way too hard to kill. Typically each new area involves nonsensical ""puzzles,"" first-person platforming, and prop hunt fetch quests to find X number of whatever arbitrary macguffin is necessary to proceed with the story; itself a paper-thin attempt to string together totally unrelated locations and make it into some kind of eco-socio-political narrative.You have to progress the plot to unlock new raft build options, but by the end of the game your beloved floating home will be reduced to an anchored manufacturing facility, solely existing to produce supplies for a series of incredibly tedious arena puzzles and annoying fight scenes.I've played Raft from its earliest iterations, alone and with friends. When it's not trying to be a knockoff of Subnautica or The Witness, it's decent fun. It's unfortunate that the final product strayed so far from the core gameplay that made it unique and enjoyable in the first place.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 11 Temmuz 2022I went in cold, and I'm really struggling to get into this.You start unarmed on a tiny featureless raft, and a shark bites off a chunk every couple minutes. The game gives you no hints for what you're supposed to do about that.The melee combat is completely numb. There's no indication that you're close enough to successfully land an attack with your pointy stick, so most times you miss on the first stab. There's no stagger or knockback behavior, so your only indication of a successful attack is sound. Good luck if you're single player; combat is clearly not balanced for that.There doesn't seem to be any pragmatic reason to build a big raft or to put a structure on it - increased raft size just makes it take longer to react to shark or seagull attacks.I'm five hours in, and so far it's just a bunch of grindy busywork keeping water and food bars full while floating between uninteresting islands. Minecraft on the open ocean, this is not.I'll update my review if I find a let's play or a getting started guide that helps. The developer should probably provide these.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 ŞubatI tried to enjoy this game, but I really couldnt.  The crafting felt like such a chore, everything required such high amounts of resources over all, and resources were so scarce, that we were nearly done before we were comfortable with the boat we had.Progression in the game is all off kilter.  Unlocks and upgrades that would be amazingly helpful in the late early to early midgame are locked to late midgame or early late game, where they dont really matter anymore.Lastly the story is... the story is sadly subpar.  The writing ins't great, the voice acting is questionable, and the quests for it are kind of miserable.  I had a save corrupt and I tried to get back to where I was as quickly as possible and having to search through the ship, or the cargo container village a second time to find the fetch quest items was miserable.Then lets not even talk about the god awful sliding tile puzzle inside of the sea dome city.  A sliding puzzle game where you have to aim the camera at each arrow to move, and doing so changes your perspective on the puzzle, meaning you are constantly looking up and down, and trying to press the buttons on the console, instead of just going into an overview and using more simplified controls.  Its by far one of the worst puzzles Iv  ever had to attempt in a game, in a long time.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Temmuz 2022Well, two friends and I waited until the release version to finally play this game. Initially, we had a lot of fun. Many fun mechanics that fit in to the game theme and make it fun. However, as we progressed the cracks started to form. Story spoilers ahead.My main issue with this game, is that it just doesn't feel finished. Many ways to cheese the puzzles and just keeping up with thirst and hunger was a bit of an issue. In the end, we had to always appoint one of us to manage crops and meat, one person was always navigating and looking for islands while the last emptied nets and crafted upgrades. Also... WHO HAD THE BRIGHT IDEA TO MAKE GLASS JARS AND CLAY BOWLS SINGLE USE?!!? This seems like a cheap way to keep old resources relevant. Having different containers only be able to store certain things feels wrong.When exploring story locations, it would have been nice to find more rare items and maybe even food items, instead of just more and more scrap/ other items you find floating on the ocean. Exploring feels boring and unrewarding.My last issue is with the final boss fight. I feel like there should have been an interesting mechanic, like we had with the Megalodon fight. But no, all you do is slash away and wait for his health to go to 0. After finishing the story, you unlock the final tier of tools. What good is that now? The game is done, there is nothing left to do or find so I have no motivation to gather the resources needed. I think it would have been much better to have these tools going in to the final fight.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 OcakRaft has a lot of good things going for it. The graphics are gorgeous in it's own cartoony style. There are a decent amount of creativity options and flexibility when building your raft, and those functions feel fluid enough. And there's even multiplayer so you can enjoy this with family/friends. It's clear that the devs/artists put a bunch of work into this, and that's why it makes me sad writing this review. It doesn't take long for the basic game play loop of surviving on a raft to feel more like a chore than fun.As far as the good. On the creative side, you can build multiple stories on your raft, paint it, and place it wherever as long as you aren't really overlapping your items too much. The exception is the foundational items, but there's a decent amount of foundational items to choose from. Not to mention there's some nice touches to the game, like a playable piano, and a clown/air horn. Once you slap a sail on your raft, the sailing also works fairly nice.The gathering of resources is okay, it isn't my favorite system, since I felt like I was spending most of my time on the raft running back and forth collecting resources from my net until the next shark attack where you smack him a few times. Since the shark attacks after x amount of minutes.The bad and the ugly. There's quality issues that plague almost every aspect of it. Water clipping through your raft which sends that dropped item out to sea. There were times because the inventory is limited and stuff would just get vacuumed out to sea. By the time I reached the point where I had a backpack which improved that situation, it was at the final point in the story. Annoying glitches/audio prioritization, like being unable to listen to a note you picked up well because the seagull and shark are attacking your raft. Not to mention, I've had the seagull twice become glitched where it was dead, but was stuck in it's attacking animation, with the audio present. Which only went away after I quit and rejoined the game, and believe me it's extremely annoying. Titanium Ingots, their description says, ""It's sooo heavy."" Which I hope is sarcasm, but given the nature of the game, and all the other issues, I doubt it. Not to mention, the random islands, are almost pointless to visit, except for being able to gather scrap/some higher end ores, and to visit the trader if you've reached the point where you've acquired what he's looking for. Fishing in this game is just click into ocean, wait to press the action button, repeat that to catch more. Kind of hoped there was more of the fishing where you spend most of it on your raft. The crafting menu's organization is confusing. The second/or third last sub menu is the category you'll spend most of your time as it builds the basic resources for almost everything else.At the end of the day, this game tries to do so many things, and falls flat on nearly every single aspect of game play. If you're looking for a survival game, with friends, and can overlook the many flaws, then go for it. But I cannot possibly recommend anyone to pay for this game in it's current state with this many quality issues.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 24 Haziran 2022Raft was a nice relaxed game with lite survival elements that had a fair sense of progression.  AT some point the development shifted away from the raft building and survival, and became a large island exploration game with awful combat and way too much useless space and flora.  The early to mid game balance is now somewhat unforgiving and frustrating.The 1.0 release got the game to the finish line in terms of story and progression, but much of the early and mid game are very unbalanced and unfun now.If you aren't turned off by the relentless attacks of animals you did not provoke, cannot avoid, and cannot deal with early on, you might stick around long enough to see some of the interesting content.  Considering that by default dying makes you lose 2/3 of your hard-earned inventory... which can sometimes put you into a death spiral,,, I would be surprised if people new to Raft even bothered to see beyond it.Redbeet; now that the end has come, please go back and iron out the rest.So many things need attention to make this game feel alive and complete.  Story and crafting items are just bricks in the wall.. but if the mortar holding them in place is weak or just plain absent, it's all for nothing.Raft has potential.  It had charm and enough systems to keep you mucking about.  But Raft's potential hasn't been realized in my opinion because seemingly simple things are just unbalanced, frustrating, or disappointing.In some stages of Early Access I would have recommended giving Raft a try.  But as 1.0 approached, and now with final release... the game is not the same and I cannot recommend it for what it has become.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 5 Haziran 2018Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is so close to being the game I've wanted for so long. I want a game where you start with nothing and build up your own little camp to higher and higher technological levels. I want ATITD but single player. I want RUST without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Sadly, instead of being a fun construction game with survival elements, instead it suffers from the major problems of most modern survival games.First of all: the hunger and thirst bars. They drop WAY too fast, even in easy mode. You will CONSTANTLY be scrambling for food and water while trying to build your raft/fort. On top of that, the tools break constantly, so you're always trying to grab everything floating towards you to build new tools. And then the shark is attacking your boat so you have to poke him off. And don't even bother tryign to get into the water, because the shark will take you down immediately. Birds assault your crops. Even if you kill them, they always come back. Same for the shark.Take a pass on this one if you want a nice construction/building up kind of game.Its all just too frantic.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiYeah, ♥♥♥♥ this game.Maybe in the future, but right now, it's a boring grind fest. 8 wood there, 12 wood there, 5 wood there, 3 wood there, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 15(!) wood there. Meanwhile you casually dig up 1 plank at a time, and total rng from the barrels. 2 Hours, and I have nothing established yet. Some floors, a couple of walls, and that's about it. 8 wooden planks for a spear, that can't even kill ONE shark before completely breaking on you. Let that sink in for a minute.Also holy crap, you're a fat ♥♥♥♥. You can't walk for 10 minutes without the need of chuging another tater or an ENTIRE FISH. Even a SHARK STEAK doesn't fill you fully. Doesn't matter if it did anyway, cause you'd be STARVING in about 20 minutes anyway. Water is a little more managable tbh, but everything now requires ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WOOD to power up. Also I'm pretty sure I burned through 3 or more planks before the damn shark decided it's bout time to become cooked.Won't say anything about the idiotic community. Just visit the forums. They'll tear you apart for saying anything even remotely suggesting, that this game isn't worth 20 dollars. (It is not, by the way. Save it, or wait for a sale.)In conclusion:  If recipe requirements were at least halved, and your personal needs wouldn't go down like the EA stocks, then maybe I could experience the game fully, and write something about THAT instead. But nope. There's a gem there, but it's hidden behind a straight out insane grind. Exactly something you need in a relaxing survival game about a life on a raft.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 9 Ocak 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiCan't recommend the game in its current state (still Early Access, so subject to change). For one, it's just a bit too light on content for the price tag. It's not a perfect comparison, but next to *that other ocean-themed crafting/survival game* there's just not a lot going on here, either in terms of plot or in things to see and do.But that's not my big complaint. The main problem is the effing shark, and the lack of an option to disable or tone it down without going all the way down to ""peaceful"" difficulty, which makes the rest of the game too easy. Having to deal with that thing ruins what would otherwise be a nice, chill exploration game. This is why games like this need custom difficulty; I would enjoy it ten times more if I could just disable shark attacks on the raft. (I suppose that if you're playing multiplayer you can have one person on shark duty, and it becomes less of a hassle. But I want to play solo.)On the positive side, I will say that Raft does look great and has a solid core of gameplay. Hopefully I can change this to positive review by the time it officially launches.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 18 Kasım 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiPros:1. Game is functionally polished feeling (programming).2. Game is artfully polished.3.

You are constantly dealing with hunger/thirst/item decay/resource scarcity, and a shark that is instantly on top of you the second you leave raft.Each problem here is easily resolved individually, unfortunately at cost of a resource that makes one of the other problems worse as a solo player. Items/hunger/thirst all decay at a brutal rate even on peaceful mode.This could be easily resolveCreate a tab in settings, called game play. Create a settings bar variable specific to that world file for hunger/thirst rate & item decay, individually. This way the player can set this to a level that doesn't ruin the enjoyment of what could be fantastic experience for an even greater number of people.Hopefully this will be implemented, would make the game INFINITELY easier to enjoy.Thank you to the developers for all their hard work on this game, I can see you put in a lot of work on it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022It's really not that great if you play solo. The non-stop forced grind rewards more players on the same map at once. You barely get the time to test and understand the game dynamics (which are not explains at all, so you gotta figure it out.. which is mostly fine, if you had more than 10 second breaks to do that)I'm guessing most players have to start a world without grind or watch videos on how to do stuff before they actually play - this is not how these games should work in my opinion.tldr, a good idea but that needs a large amount of work on the actual solo gameplay so that it's fun and rewarding rather than long and annoying - that's a rather deal-breaking flaw..",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Şubat 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiLittle old me two weeks ago with forty bucks in my Steam wallet and a discovery queue bursting at the seams with mediocre looking games. Among the mediocre games, the least mediocre-looking of which was Raft, a survival game where you start on a raft moving a tad too fast with nothing but a hook, your wits, and a whole lot of gumption. The entire goal of the game is to constantly throw the thing into the water to grab things (materials) used to craft things that allow you to gather things faster. And also a shark bites a hunk off your raft every so often.When I came into this game, I was excited about the multiplayer aspect and played it with a friend of mine who bought it shortly after me. Let me just be blunt here. The multiplayer in Raft sucks. It's the same sandbox as the singleplayer, except now you've got the boys with you ready to sluck down a frosty saltwater and wash it down with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ raw catfish that doesn't fit on the grill then stabbing him to death with the wooden spear that has three pokes more durability than it takes to kill Dimitri in the first place for stealing your bundle of palm leaves.Play something else.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 22 Temmuz 2022I used to love this game, I even tried to like it after the final update, but it's so far removed from what it used to be that it's become a Frankenstein's monster of poor writing and bad decisions held together by duct tape and vine goo.The base building side of this game is great. Fending off Bruce, fishing, looting islands (I even forgive the cut and paste terrain), searching the oceans etc is fun and multiplayer makes it even better.But then came the jumping puzzles and more jumping puzzles and janky plot. This final chapter is a parkour nightmare. Some jumping puzzles I get, sure, but at this point it's filler to make the game longer with as little effort as possible.It's lazy writing; the equivalent of killing the dog off in a horror film. This game has such a devoted fan base that this kind of poor development is a bit of a kick in the pants.To add insult to injury there's no working save function. The save world function does indeed save the world, but not your player status so it's possible to reload your latest save and be incapacitated on the floor.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Temmuz 2022Unfun, unpolished.Don't bother unless you're playing with friends and got it on sale otherwise you're just going to have a miserable time.The combat sucks, being incredibly barebones and having to fight against incredibly annoying enemy designs, like birds that fly around and drop rocks on you if you stand still but take too much effort to try killing.The shark quickly just becomes annoying tedium that occasionally nibbles at you if you're too slow.The puzzles are almost all horrible and dull, most of the time you just wander around the story island you're at looking for a few items to pick up to make a glorified key to unlock the next area and other times you get things like a sliding block puzzle or stacking boxes.The story is awful and I just ended up tuning it out myself, the game felt like it ended almost out of nowhere.Lacking resources at times when the islands are covered with them, I can understand not taking a whole door off for scrap but plenty of islands will be covered in large trees that you just aren't allowed to cut down at all.Your character hates recycling. Drank from a glass cup? Had your soup from a bowl or meal from a plate? Used a bucket of milk to make a drink? Your equipment's battery ran out of charge? It's gone for good, no reusing or recharging, it's a wonder the player doesn't crush and throw away your plastic bottle into the ocean after drinking all the water in it.Building is severely lacking, ladders can't be placed up against walls or float on their own so you can't have ladders trailing down from the top of your raft like a boat if you wanted. Destroying the wrong structure when renovating can cause everything on top of it to be destroyed instead of being dropped or placed into your inventory. Paint is applied sloppily on walls and leaves little strips where you can see the original wood underneath.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 2022Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiI tried to like this game, I really did. In the end I was forced to conclude that Raft is not an enjoyable game and request a refund. Basically, this game fails entirely as a survival and exploration game and exists solely as a boring exercise in multiplayer endgame. I'll explain....I play a lot of survival games, so I'll review Raft by comparison to the other offerings out there.(1) Raft lacks sufficient instruction, be it by in-game information, tutorial or prologue, to assist the player in getting the hang of the controls and just how things are meant to be done. I'm not talking about getting a grip on the environment or what you need to understand to survive, I'm talking about understanding what the controls do. The control scheme is not intuitive and simple actions require multiple steps that are not made clear.(1a) All this takes place, mind you, in a game that has no pause function and in which your health and resources are *rapidly* declining and passing you by.(2) The opener of the game puts you in a situation where you know almost nothing, lack basic resources or the means to easily obtain them, lack the knowledge of what to do about that, and in which your health and even the size of your working environment are quickly declining. No doubt people who have given this game a thumbs up will call this situation ""challenging"", but I found it tedious and annoying.(3) Speaking of tedium, the path to survival in this beginning is the most boring and tedious I have ever encountered with no room for improvisation or figuring out the parameters of the game.(4) Access to any game assets that can improve your situation and therefore lead to more innovative gameplay are locked on islands that you have to luck into running across and which, upon your arrival, you are prevented from accessing by means of multiple powerful guardians that you must take on with nothing more than a wooden spear as you know how to build nothing else until you are able to explore the island. A giant bird that drops rocks on your head? Obnoxious.(5) Every passionate fan who purported to help beginners lacked any useful information about how to play the actual game and always defaulted to the same advice... invite a friend to your world to help you. In other words, the only way to play this game, in the opinion of those who like it, is as a primarily multiplayer experience.So what does this mean? In short, this game fails as an enjoyable single-player experience. It is tedious and lacks the kind of wondrous exploration and discovery that much better survival games include. It is organized in such a way that the only actual point of the game is to struggle to the endgame (probably with outside help) in order to build a cool party boat and invite people to join you on it.If that sounds like your cup of tea, enjoy the game. If my description sounds like a waste of your limited and valuable recreation time, run away and take this game off your wishlist. Cheers.",N/A

Glad to see i's making other people satisfied but there is just too much frustration for me to mull through to enjoy this game.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 27 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiAfter finishing the full release game:While the raft itself is fun, it is the only thing I truly enjoyed after replaying the game. Building and designing your home is cool and quite well done but everything else is lacking. The story places you can find are quite chaotic and navigating them is a pain. Even after revisiting some of them for the xth time and spending quite a bit of time there i had absolutely no orientation or idea of where what is. finding everything is difficult and frustrating and you have to go back and forth multiple times to complete everything. for most places that is not a huge problem but it does reduce the fun you could have there. Well, the 3 places added in the new update are probably the worst of them. One bigger than the next, with immense distances between points you can interact with. the second to last was well designed and probably the most unusual and outstanding location, which was nice, but all places are still way too similar. emty rooms, doors you cannot open, spread out, no signs of life anywhere. The last location was the BIGGEST disappointment. after following the story and practically chasing the people we read/ hear of from one point to the next we are finally where they are supposed to be but the place is still empty. the story only unravels in the very very end but not even in a good or satisfying way. the last location is also a pain in that there is a LOT of platforming for which the game is just not made for. my bf and i spent way too long trying to complete one platforming challenge and it was probably the least fun we ever had with a game.adittionaly, the boss fights are just annoying and way too long, they add nothing to the story or the game.After waiting for almost 2 years for the finished game this ended in a huge disappointment. while you certainly can have fun with the game it does not live up to the hype at all..._________So, just for your information: I have only played this game in multiplayer with a friend but the 35 hours I put into the game have also convinced me that ""Raft"" is only really fun in multiplayer. I really would not want to play this on my own because the every-day activities would just be too annoying. You have to plant stuff, make sure there is always water on the raft, care for the bees and other animals, make food, build, craft, collect stuff from out of the water, navigate to your next destination, etc etc.In conclusion, if you are alone on your raft all of these task would just annoy you into not playing. Even with two people the starting phase of getting into the game took 10 hours!!!!! Time that we spent collecting and crafting until we were finally able to find islands and get into the story. These first 10 hours were so tiring that we considered putting the game aside. We were playing the peaceful mode, mind you, in which the animals were not out for our blood. These beasts were the reason we initially changed mode because the shark that keeps following you attacks every few seconds once you are in the water, making gathering stuff near islands almost impossible as you die almost immediately. The lurkers (mutated rats) are just as bad. There are several locations in which you will encounter them in neverending masses, constantly re-spawning and, if they were to attack you, kill all the fun as well as your character.This aside (so in multiplayer and peaceful mode) the game is actually pretty nice. I like the idea of being stranded on the ocean, without much land in sight (except for the few islands that you come across). There is also quite a lot that you can do, from crafting to catching animals, growing plants, building, exploring, etc. The story is also quite good but you actively have to look for it. Like I said, it took us 10 hours to finally find the first bit of story, which is a looooong time for things to happen. Without the story the mechanics get boring rather quickly.I also don't think that the achievements are helpful because many of them are just ""Kill x lurkers/bears/sharks/etc"", ""Hook 5000 items"", etc. Usually archievements push me to try different things in game or make me want to challenge myself (like the ""Kill mama bear"" in this game) but telling the player to keep playing in order to get all achievements is kinda lame...All in all I have to recommend the game (I did not put 35 hours into it for nothing) but there is a lot of potential that has not been fully worked with (yet). If you are looking for a nice multiplayer game then give ""Raft"" a try, you might like it :)Edit: There are parts with quite a lot of platforming, for which this game is definitely not made. Especially in the end location there is a lot of jumping involved and it doen't always go as planned. After falling for the xyth time (and maybe even dying because of it) is just plain annoying and trying to make the game longer than it actually is or had to be. It's just rustrating, especially with the controlls not being as precise as they would have to be.Edit 2: After completing the story and setting out to find the ""hidden"" extras I am more frustrated with the game than ever. There are two special islands you can discover but they only have a chance of 2% to spawn. After 75 hours in this game have found neither of them. There are also a few collecting things (you can dig up treasures) but they are equally annoying. we have found an iteam you need four different ones of FOUR TIMES (the same one, so it's absolutely useless). This is just bad game design at this point.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 14 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiBefore I write this review, I would like the say the concept of this game is great. The first 5 hours was great fun but the lack of updates has let this game down. It is completely unfinished and all the updates that have come out are poor. I was so excited for Chapter 2, which I waited a year for, but it brought you away from your raft to boring exploration areas. I want to see new items that you can craft that will help you on your journey but still nothing to date that makes the game better. Survival isn't hard either which is boring.

"Yayınlanma: 9 Haziran 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI'd love to fully recommend this game, and I think the game will ""eventually"" get to the point where I'd recommend it. Let's start with what I liked.Playing this with a friend is a decent way to spend 10 hours. Figuring out all the different ways to optimize your raft, and splitting up duties is a great time. You're constantly managing a lot of your resources and health early on, and you really feel a huge punch upwards every time you creep up the tech tree and get a new item. The general method of resource collection is a little funny, but I won't complain too much, as it does make sure you never run out of something you need.Now for the bad. The worst part is that while the game gives you a ton of tools to make your raft more efficient, we never experienced anything that made the game harder. Yeah sure, the Shark keeps coming back, but we have great weapons to fight him off, and extra layers of wood for him to eat if we can't be bothered. Events like multiple sharks, or literally any other enemy group coming after us would be great.Now for the really bad part. Many of you may have played this game and had a different experience. For us, we made it all the way to the last part of chapter 1, and no enemies/animals spawned on the final island. The entire time we were finding various objects and resources that appeared to serve no use whatsoever. This culminated with a final note saying something to the effect of ""HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE GAME LIKE US ON FACEBOOK"". I get it, it's an indie game, and early access. But wow, uh, maybe check to see if your final island is actually spawning encounters to provide some challenge to the end game. Or really spawning animals at all, I don't know, there was a ton of stuff I think was supposed to show up and never did.1-2 years from now, I think this could really be something great. As is...wait until at least Chapter 2 comes out. I may update my review then, but either way, it's not like I can undo the progress of more or less ice skating through the last bit of content in chapter 1.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 21 Haziran 2022Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiAs a basebuilder and exploration game, it is fine. As a survival game, it fails on step one. The goal in any survival game essentially comes down to bar management, you try your best to keep all bars high, and sometimes have to sacrifice some of one bar to fill the other. The motivation to explore, build and take risks, comes in the pursuit of keeping those bars filled. However, this game offers many easy, quickly granted and replicable ways of keeping those bars filed indefinitely. With little to no challenge in keeping those methods up. As a result, you do not feel adequately compelled to pursue opportunities or improve your station, and consequently, to continue playing.TLDR: Too easy to survive. Felt no need to expand or explore.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 2022I want to like this game allot but they have released content for contents sake.  you get 3 blueprints at the very end of the game all of which would have made life a lot more reasonable if they came earlier in the game.  they seem to have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ confused with the story when they did the rewrite and just shoved in the content in the end so they had the normal numbers of BP per island.the kids will probably enjoy it well enough and not notice the issues. for some one who enjoys the builder type games you will need to mod the game heavly to get proper enjoyment out of it.  the game seems fun but not overly well thought out.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 13 Temmuz 2022I gotta say this final boss fight is so tedious that after waiting for so long for this chapter, only to find out it is the final one, has lowered my ""recommend"" to ""only if you really love the way building your raft works."" I'm literally in the middle of it. I stopped to type this review.Maybe the multiplayer is more fun than single. Too bad I don't have any interested friends. I'm close to finishing the game, but I don't know if I'll ever play it again after finishing the ultimately disappointing story. Sadly I'm thinking ""is it worth it to grind for X resource, or should I just do something less frustrating and possibly more entertaining like watching paint dry."" I have spent hours drifting along, dutifully upgrading my raft, painting the walls, collecting resources and hoping for a new adventure on the horizon. Maybe I've just spent too much time doing that. The random islands don't feel very random. The fight mechanic is all jab and jump back, and my raft never stops feeling like something built out of Zaks (remember those? look it up on wikipedia) no matter how many vending machine potted plants I place or pixelated paintings decorate my walls. The level design is mediocre and when it isn't abundantly obvious what to do, I find myself glancing at a walkthru instead of exploring because the set dressing is so much copy and paste of the same basic elements that if I'm not constantly thinking of the lore there really isn't anything to do or look at.I wish I didn't feel annoyed at the bombs being thrown at me or the mobs biting me. I wish I still felt invested. I wish it didn't feel one directional, and that there was anything else to this. Comparisons to Minecraft are inevitable and while the main story there didn't exactly get me either, at least I could make interesting contraptions with redstone. In Raft, I can enjoy the same pleasures I get in daily life like recharging batteries and remembering to drink enough water so I don't die.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Şubat 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game is fun for like 10 minutes til you realize that the entire game is basicly you fishing items from the ocean to build your raft bigger and repair it from the constant shark attacks.When you get to mid game and start needing items from the islands more than the debris floating in the sea the game then turns to a waiting game trying while trying to find islands to harvest their resources.And when you finally get to an island you have to kill the shark before you can dive in the sea to get the underwater stuff so you have to wait for the shark to attack you a few times till you damage it enough to kill it.so basicly... if you dont like doing the smae thing over and over for early game. and waiting around for hours during mid game... then DON`T buy thisEdit:Just gave this game a new chance as a friend of mine bought it (against my recomentdation) and like me he quickly grew bored with it.

"Yayınlanma: 11 Aralık 2022The raft building mechanics are very good and Its really fun for the first 15 hours or so while you build up your raft. However after that you are required to go to story islands to get new parts for your raft. These story islands range between pretty fun, (the second to last island) to some of the least fun I've had in a game for a long time (the last and third to last locations) You walk around for a long time essentially pixelhunting and running away from respawning enemies because there's no point fighting them as it just breaks your stuff, praying to find the random item that you need to complete the island.Worst of this is that while you're at this point your raft is pretty much finished giving you essentially no reason to even use 90% of the new blueprints that you gain from these islands. On top of this, the blueprints often require titanium to make which is a pain to get with the metal detector. So you end up just doing the same stuff you always do, and just buy it with trash cubes.Overall 5/10 game, fun first half ruined by an extremely boring and rushed second half.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI had been waiting to buy Raft in a sale for quite some time and was looking forward to playing it.What a disappointment, the game really is not setup for solo play, and has some nasty features that make it quite enjoyable.You start off on a small raft that is drifting through floating items, with a hook on a rope.  You then spend time trying to catch the items. Once you have enough you can then craft things you need, more raft, hooks, water desalination, all very good and quite enjoyable.Now for the negatives. First the darn shark, it is always there, you have seconds in the water before you are attacked. It also has watched too many movies and thinks it is the star in Jaws, it keeps attacking your raft. As you only start with 4 squares it does not take long to die. Yes you can build more, but then it is a choice between eaten by shark or die of thirst as you cant build the desalination.Then you run into islands, sounds great till you realise you cant push the raft off and if you dont have a paddle yet, you are stuck there unable to gather any materials till you die. You can't swim to gather things due to the shark.Now why this is not for solo play, If you die you have a choice, wait for a rez or respawn. Obviously there is no one to give a rez, so you respawn. You respawn on your raft minus everything you were carrying.To start a new game you have to create a new world, you can't delete them without manually finding and deleting the save files.Don't get me wrong I like a challenge and quite like a grind, but this was not fun.  I tried 4 times to get past either the shark or the island. I gave up just before the 2hr cutoff for the refund and bought Escape the Pacific instead, a much better game that you can solo.",N/A

It IS malware that will drain your data, and if you are in a country with a limit on how much data you can stream a month (like I am) it makes it impossible to keep the game running without worrying that you will run out your data limit while playing!

"Yayınlanma: 27 Kasım 2022I've seen some fun videos on YouTube and decided to pick up this game as an ocean survival/island exploration/raft building adventure with a bit of story to tie things together.Unfortunately the new player experience is Bad. I'm sure the game gets better later, but for a game that's no longer in early access the first part of the game is honestly pretty terrible. You're spawned in on a tiny raft with zero guidance on how to do anything or any context as to why you're there and a super annoying hungry shark that ruthlessly circles and attacks you if you so much as dip your toe in the water, and will even eat your raft. For an early access game not having some kind of new player tutorial is fine and understandable, but for a ""released"" game this is just bad game design, like you had to have played the game through early access to know what to do (or read a wiki). Not Cool.There's also some stupid bugs/design oversights I'm running into early on in the game where you literally can't pick up rocks/scrap on islands. They have to be fully underwater for the game to let you use the hook animation to pick them up, but it won't trigger on land. Understandable for early access, not acceptable for a ""released"" game.Plus no controller support seems like a strange design oversight, these types of games are perfect for the Steam Deck or the big screen, but for some reason the devs never bothered.I'm only a very short time into the game and hope it gets better later, but initial impressions don't reflect well on the developers IMHO. Feels like they got to a certain point in development and just slapped a 1.0 on the game without actually fixing/polishing the game first or considering how it would play for brand new players and not just the returning people from early access who already know how to play the game. As a rule I don't recommend early access games that go to 1.0 with significant issues still present, so this game gets a thumb down from me even though it does look like it will be more fun later.I'm not sure if the devs plan on actually doing any more fixes to the game, but here's my 2 cents on how it could be vastly improved with fairly minimal effort:1. Add a short intro sequence. Subnautica is a good example, have a storm or something where your character gets washed overboard/out to sea and wakes up in the ocean on the tiny raft. Enough to give some context as to what happened and why you're there.2. Remove the shark from the very early game (at least on the recommended normal difficulty). Only have it show up after a certain milestone has been reached, start the player off gently rather than subjecting them to a bunch of cheap deaths right off the bat.3. Have some kind of basic tutorial in-game giving some basic suggestions on what to craft right away for survival needs and where to find basic materials.4. Fix the resource gathering bugs5. Add controller support and get the game verified for the Steam Deck (it runs just fine on mine, but the controls are wonky).Hopefully we'll get another quality of life and polish update now that the game is pretty much done content wise (at least going off the announcements).",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 19 MartThe game is good, but i have 2 major issues with it:First, this is a game that doesnt respect your time. It's the first game I actually feel this, despite having played many other games with major grinds. The problem with Raft is not the grind. It's that 8 out of every 10 sessions,  you come out after 3 hours feeling like you acomplished nothing. You look back at your session and you realize you spent it 75% of the time running around to get/make food and water for your character not to starve or dehidrate. Add to that, that your progress when it happens, comes out of RNG. The chance of finding a new blueprint is random, as is the blueprint you will find.Second, you can't pause the game. This kills it for me. It may seem minor, but it's not. It's a bulding/survival game, chances are you will do long sessions, and you can't pause. Only way is to save and leave back to the main menu.These 2 things have caused me to give up after a couple of sessions, every time I try to pick this game up again from my library. And its sad because there's a good game in there somewhere.",N/A

The pictures of the rafts that they advertise will take hours just to build something like that. The mechanic of hooking in resources in is not advertised at all in the pictures and is fun for a bit but becomes boring quickly. The islands you can explore are predictable, all just seem to have flowers for dyes and trees to chop down. If you like harder survival games this might be for you but it isn't difficult, it just requires a lot of grinding to progress.The only thing that was ok in the game was the multiplayer.

"Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022Raft is a good game in concept but you then discover the grind, and the story gets worse as it progresses. The final chapter is nothing but puzzles and annoying boss fight with endlessly spawning enemies that aren't affected by AOE attacks but can drag you in and chain you to death, but if you die you lose all your items. So you need to grind for all the gear and equipment, wait around forever for things to be made and fill yourself up with enough stuff to deal with all the annoyances the story brings. Honestly, play it for the sandbox if you can manage it and just ignore the story because its really not that great. A previous boss fight you have to get a boss to do the same thing 20 times to kill it. It just gives you an ending slideshow and thats about it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Temmuz 2022This game is fun until you get to any of the story locations, instantly becomes the most unfun walking simulator. While exploring these expansive areas, you still need to manage your food and water. Also, in multiplayer, if someone gets downed, the only way to revive them is for them to go back to the ship. Why can you not revive them anywhere? It completely kills the flow of the gameplay and becomes a huge chore for everyone.

"Yayınlanma: 28 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft has potential to be a good game however currently (as of this writing) it seems to be very lacking in content.----------------The game is fun at first as you explore and learn but eventually you learn how to jump into the water and kill a shark without taking any damage.  At that point all you need to worry about is having a spare spear at all times, food, water, and supplies for expanding your raft. Without the element of fear the shark provided the game becomes very dull. You can build up your raft but eventually you'll be happy with the size and just farm supplies you will only really use on spears, food, and water.----------------Endgame content at this stage is very disappointing.. It feels like an unscientific pushed liberal agenda about climate change. Do yourself a favor and do not build a radar if you are planning on playing creative mode. In fact.. playing creative mode will quickly sap all enjoyment you get out of this game.----------------Crafting is pretty good as far as implimentation. Pretty straight forward... Find X amount of resources to craft item. Build research table to  allow researching of new things to build. Some material icons do look similar so you may end up farming the wrong resource completely if you're not paying attention. We did find amount of things to craft severely lacking.----------------Building needs some work but is a good start. You have the ability to make multiple floors but they have to be connected to support beams otherwise they cannot be placed or they break. While I understand structures need support I feel like they could have been 3 tiles apart rather than one tile always touching at least one beam. Building a wide room without ugly beams or walls crowding it is not possible from what I can see. Getting onto the top of islands requires ugly ramps on all sides of your raft to allow you to gather the resources on top. One ramp could have been fine but the devs completely spaced on the idea of a rudder to turn the raft. Currently the only way to turn a raft is to ram into something until you're facing the way you want to be facing.----------------Fishing is very boring.. You wait for the signal then press a button to instantly put the item you caught in your inventory.----------------Boat rocking back and forth may trigger some motion sickness in people. A server option in the future to disable all raft rotation other than yaw would be a nice feature for these people as storms can get really bad.----------------Day night cycle uses dynamic lighting to cast shadows and aligns light rays with the sun or moon's currently position. Other sources of light appear to light by range only meaning that a light on your top floor will light your bottom floor as well even with obstacles in the way.----------------Survival elements consist of thirst, hunger, and health. When either hunger or thirst is in the red you will move much more slowly which can be a death sentence if you happen to be in the water at the time. Water must be purified before you can drink it. Food needs to be cooked to achieve full benefits of the meal. Grills can be used to cook food but require consumeable wood planks to operate. The shark will attack you and break your foundation support. Damaged foundation can be repaired at the cost of materials.----------------Shark AI is ok but not great. In my game with a friend the shark seemed determined to kill me forcing me to stay on the raft at all times as my friend was able to swim around and gather resources in the water. I feel as if this needs to be reworked. #1 A check to see which players are in open water. #2 A proximity to the raft check which prioritizes players who are farther away and spawning another shark temporarily if the distance between players is too great. This will prevent players from swimming out as suicide bait as others gather resources in the water.Another issue with the shark is what foundation is targeted. Sometimes the shark will clip through your boat and start attacking the center foundation of your raft which may be holding your source of food or water. Sharks should only attack foundation tiles that have sides exposed to 2D tile ocean. This should include outer and inner ocean tiles. For instance a [] shaped raft with no foundation in the middle.Last but not least is the shark pathfinding near islands. The shark will swim inside the island clipping through rocks and do suprise attacks on you. This would be find if this was tremors but somehow I don't feel that is what they were going for.----------------According to devs the game does not currently have a player limit which can quickly lead to some unbalancing issues. More players means more food and water and unless if the materials scale as well then you will have a lot of players starving to death due to lack of resources.----------------Another issue with multiplayer appears to be griefing. From what I see it would be very easy to join a players game and screw them before leaving.----------------Overall it was fun for about 6 hours with a friend before it started to get repeatitive and boring.  I don't recommend getting it atm but if devs continue to improve it then it can develop into a worthwhile game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 OcakEverytime I play this game it was only because a friend wanted to and the thought of completing it.This game is extremely frustrating to play, you just eat and drink and do genuinely ♥♥♥♥ all for several hours with pointless gathering.

"Yayınlanma: 13 Temmuz 2022This game has a ton of potential to be really fun, but constantly gets in its own way. There doesn't seem to be much effort put into quality of life.. managing inventory is very tedious, no way to quickly sort your inventory from your person to chest. There is Bruce the shark who attacks your raft constantly. And I mean CONSTANTLY. Its way over the top to the point of just being obnoxious. You have to eat more food in a day than I eat in an entire week just to not starve to death... water needs to be drank every few minutes just to not die of thirst...and they make common building supplies a total pain in the ass to get constantly. Even the ways that are ""easier"" are a pain in the ass. OH and the game literally glitched out one of our engines. It was on my friends screen and not mine, and then we reloaded in and it was just gone despite knowing for a fact the shark didnt eat it.What the game gets right is the story you follow, finding new things on bigger islands, and the progression of gear seems to be good. That is, if it weren't for supplies all being a pain to gather. But there are a lot of cool items to help you progress and the boat building is a lot of fun and also well done. Tons of decorative items to add to the boat.I love survival games, but on this one I just felt like our group could never get anything done outside of making food, drinking water, fighting off the shark, and rebuilding stuff that the shark ate. It started off fun and quickly just became super annoying to play. I feel like just a little more thought about quality of life stuff for the players would make this game much more enjoyable. Like I said, a lot of things in place in the game got us excited to play. But then you spend 2 hours just trying to fix your boat from shark attacks and fishing for food... Playing other survival games where I'm only eating and drinking a few times per day brings tears of joy to my eyes after playing this game. And having a shark attack is a fun idea but having it attack as frequent as it does isnt a fun challenge at all. It quickly becomes obnoxious. If the games on sale maybe try it? But looking back on the game I felt like I was just annoyed most of the time despite there being a lot of potential in this game. A few updates would probably help this game out a ton IMO.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiBeat the game now that it's finally released. Spoiler free review in this section:The primary game loop is to just drift in the ocean and fish up junk while managing starvation and dehydration. I'd categorize this game as a ""cozy"" game, if your character wasn't constantly dehydrating and starving, making you fret over your survival chores to keep from getting sick. It's almost as if the entire game has this identity issue as it constantly pushes mechanics on the player while they're trying to relax.Survival elements are tedious, at best. Other that starving, the game implements various systems through-out exploration that require micromanagement. The raft quickly begins to feel like a floating prison of chores, where the player has to rush between tasks such as farming, resource production, cooking, and drink making between locations; effectively removing any ""cozy"" from the game as one rushes from place to place to get the bare minimum done before reaching the next location.Combat is in the game, but this too also suffers an identity issue. Enemies range from trivial and easy to outmaneuver to outright deadly or tedious to fight. With some enemies have deranged, high health bars and the ability to swoop far outside of range before coming back to harass the player endlessly, and other enemies simply having bad ai that causes them to get stuck in either broken loops to make them worthless, or broken loops to make them far deadlier than needed, enemies are truly annoying at best. Armor is in the game, but seems to do little to nothing in combat, either providing a simply cosmetic buff, or just plain not doing enough to make it worth the highly expensive craft requirements, as one resource must be gathered directly from enemies, and only certain enemies, which can only be found in certain places or certain islands.Graphics are primarily the best thing to see in the game. Although they aren't particularly groundbreaking in any way, the art direction is enjoyable, and the aesthetic of what you can do with your raft as well as the setting is over-all nice. However, the game is very childish in presentation, from dialogue that can't decide whether the game is meant for kids or adults, to story arc and characters being so childish and 'safe' that the game really can't get anywhere near an adult level of dialogue.Spoilers below:As far as the storyline goes, it again runs into this identity issue, where it tries to get adult, but quickly falls into childishness. The main villain, or primary villain that can be found out about, is just some deranged guy that has hyenas for some reason, and manages to overpower an entire city and trick them into getting locked into a room you later save them from. But, the games childishness doesn't end there;The game obviously takes a different direction at a certain point, as it begins to emphasize platforming at a point. This is horrible, as the in game model from first person doesn't even have feet, lending to awkward misjudgments as you have no clue exactly where your character's going to land half the time, or exactly where your character's feet stand. The game is also, obviously, not designed for platforming as there are no climb mechanics, no previous jump puzzles, and no previous need to really climb anything other than follow footpaths or exploit up the side of a mountain, leading to even further identity crisis.TLDR: The game seemed to be intended for a mass audience, primarily catering to young teenagers, or late children, but has too punishing of a resource management / enemy system to make it available to them while also alienating a lot of adult players with a childish story, and alienating ""cozy game"" enthusiasts with constant chores.Do you like constant, relentless chores in a cozy environment with childish aesthetics? Then, this is your game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Temmuz 2022I like this game, i think it brings a lot of new concepts and thats great. But frankly its about as accessible as the staircase to a 10th floor apartment with no elevator. It's unkind to all players, with often adding needless tedium (like you eat bowls, glasses and buckets instead of re-using, which is ironically wasteful given the theme) and excessive micromanagement (everything is manual, no ability to automate.). This game also needs captions desperately. There's no way to know the shark is chewing on your boat unless you see him, and if you're impaired,  directionality is confusing as well.  RSI? Look elsewhere, so much excessive clicking, no batch crafting or processing in anyway.Do I like the game? Yah, but I can't recommend it when so many people (GAMERS) are disabled and this thing is in this state.  Message me when you add (enough) accessibility and I'll change this review.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Haziran 2022I played for an hour and refunded.  I couldn't figure out what I was doing at all, and the whole time was spend stressed and annoyed.  Maybe there is more of a game here, but I couldn't get to it.  I played on normal difficulty.  Yes, I know there are easier difficulties, but the game isn't hard.  It's just annoying and repetitive.Summary - The game is a confusing mess of disjointed ideas that don't work well together and aren't fun.Pros:- Art direction is pretty good.  Not amazing, but does what it needs to do.- Unique premise.Cons:- Zero instructions or tutorial on anything.  The game just dumps you on a raft and asks you to figure out everything by trial and error.  I could never figure out how to use the research bench.  I might have been able to figure it out except for...- Everything requires constant monitoring and clicking.  Everything requires constant refilling of resources.  You can't ever store much anywhere, so most of your time is spend gathering the resources and running in circles clicking on all your stations to refill them.  I barely had time to even look at the crafting menu because I was dying of hunger or thirst, the shark was taking a bite out of my raft, or the bird was eating my crops.- Everything degrades with use.  Tools have to be re-crafted a lot.  It's another resource and time sink in a game that has too much of that already.  Again, I felt like I was only able to keep myself alive, much less get anywhere.- Every item and station has a different interface.  Sometimes stations have hotpoints that you have to click on to do something.  Sometimes you have to have a particular item in your hand and then click, other times the game automatically takes something out of your inventory.  Why does the water purifier take planks out of my inventory to fuel it but doesn't take the cup of salt water unless it is in my hand?  Sometimes stations have a menu that opens, none of which are consistent or have any labels.  Buttons have no tooltips or indicators about why some are active and some are not.- Items have no descriptions.  How much food does a raw potato vs. a cooked potato fill?  As far as I could tell, the difference was negligible, but I don't really have any idea.  Which kind of fish is bigger and better to cook?  No idea, since even the icon is only the fish head.  What kind of fluid is currently in my cup?  How long does something take to cook?- Why would I bother building walls or really anything other than a flat raft with stations randomly strewn across it?  What is the point of a bed?  Day and night don't seem to make any difference and there is no sunburn.  It doesn't get dark.  There is no weather.  I don't get tired.- Why is the shark eating my raft?  I get attacking me when I get in the water, but sharks don't eat wood.  Is this trying to be Jaws?  It's a pretty small and unmotivated shark for that.  Taking out a square of my raft every five minutes is hardly really trying.  Doesn't it have anything better to do that follow my raft around forever?  Did I murder its family before the game started or something?",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2022I love this type of game, and I really enjoyed its predecessor from Axolot, Scrap Mechanic, so I had high hopes for Raft. But I have to say that I'm feeling somewhat disappointed here.The whole experience feels underdeveloped and one-dimensional. The main threat in the ocean besides food and drink is a murderously aggressive shark — really? That gets old real fast. Okay, there are a few other deadly fish in the water, but c'mon guys, be a little more creative maybe... the ocean is full of terrors, not just monstrous sealife.I also think the sailing and boat mechanics could be so much more interesting, considering this is a boat-based survival game. The physics of wind and water are pretty primitive; for example, apparently there's no center of mass or drag here, you just point your sail in a direction and the entire raft moves along that vector, no matter where on the boat the sail resides.I was also stunned by the fact that you only have the ONE raft and can't build another one. Oh, you hopped onto an island to collect some pineapples and your raft floated away into the great blue? Too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad, this run is over, time to commit suicide so you can respawn on the raft. Is it just me or is that a bit ridiculous? You're telling me this wayfaring carpenter can build a sail and a clock from scrap wood and hairpins, but placing the foundation of a new raft is IMPOSSIBLE?It's all a bit more fun with other people in multiplayer, but overall this game gets a big MEH rating from me.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 15 Ağustos 2022Let me start by saying that the raft building is well made and can be fun for a while, until you try to actually get anywhere.I bought this way back when it first came out in Early Access so I've started over from scratch quite a few times. Every time the same thing has happened: I get started and it feels quite satisfying to solve the initial problems of fighting off the shark and getting a steady supply of food and water.Unfortunately, in order to get more advanced equipment, you have to follow the storyline and visit different story islands, and this is where the game starts getting annoying. Each different island has one or more ""puzzles"" you have to solve, but the main problem here is that you never really know what the pieces are, much less how they're supposed to fit together. Most of the islands are so big, systematically searching them is a real challenge because on most of them you really have no clue where you are, what exactly you're looking for or where your damned raft with all your food and water actually is. And when you finally stumble across something that might look useful, you can bet your life you're either out of food/water, your inventory is full or the sun goes down so you can't see anything.Your raft, a mobile base, is supposed to be the focus of the game and the center piece of it all but the majority of your time is spent away from it trying to solve poorly made puzzles while wishing you were back at the raft where life is simple.And then there's the voice acting. You pick up these notes that piece together a sort of storyline and early on these were text only, which was considerably less painful than listening to swedes trying to speak english. Thankfully, many of the recordings are of such poor quality it's hard to hear the voice at all.After much frustration and looking up walkthroughs online, I made it to the final island where the game suddenly takes another sharp right turn and decides it wants to be the Tomb Raider game that got canned because the 3D platformer elements were just too annoying. Having stumbled, fallen down and cursed my way through an out of place obstacle course from American Ninja Warrior ONCE, then solving another stupid ""puzzle"" I then realized I had to go through that same damned obstacle course ONE MORE TIME. Don't forget that all this time you have to keep eating and drinking every few minutes to stay alive, and roughly 50% of the time is spent in darkness so you can barely make out the obstacles. After another hour of this I finally decided enough is enough.There are so many annoying things in this game, even if you use a third party mod tool with half a dozen mods to eliminate the most annoying ones, you will eventually quit because the game is still just too annoying. Eating and drinking literally every couple of minutes. Tools and weapons that barely hold together. Batteries that last only a few minutes and can't be recharged until nearly the end of the game. Seagulls that literally consume the scarecrows meant to keep them away. Sharks that eat your raft no matter how many times you kill them. Bears and other wildlife that respawn literally faster than they can be killed. The game just keeps piling problems on problems to keep you from wanting to reach the end because the end is pointless anyway.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 22 Ekim 2022At the beginning, Raft is a wonderfully fresh take on the Survival genre.  Despite the fact that there is a shark trying to eat you and/or your raft, the game has a very calm and peaceful feeling.  If this was how the game stayed, it would have been wonderful.As you follow the story line, you get a masterclass in awful game design.  They throw just about every bad game puzzle trope at you.  Laser/mirror puzzles, sliding block puzzle, platforming puzzles. There are boss fights.  The story part of the game is so radically different than the core game that it's baffling.",N/A

The thirst and hunger bars drop too quickly even on easy mode.Fishing is boring.

The shark (the only enemy in the game, unless you count seagulls) attacks your boat every 5 minutes until you kill it, then it's replaced by another shark that does the same, which is a tiresome and endless loop. You have to eat about every 5 minutes, even after totally filling up which is just frustrating.You spend basically all of your time at sea, reeling in materials with your hook and buliding on to your raft. It sounds boring but it's actually quite fun, until you see land and the game's bad mechanics hinder you from getting to said land.

An attempt to copy the popularity of survival games over the last few years with admittedly a new fresh gimmick but arrives completely lacking heart, soul or mind - this is the bare body of what a game in this genre should be.Loved it for the first few hours but dreaded having to play it after maybe around 5-7 hours in.Assumed it was a great game because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews but its just not; it doesn't have enough wrong with it to be a bad game, it just scrapes ok i guess.- 'Puzzles' consist of looking for things that you can interact with rather than actually thinking, possibly the most frustrating part of the game, 'puzzles' are there for the sake of having the player do something but don't credit you with the ability to learn mechanics and apply them to actual puzzles.- Bad/lazy implementation of mechanics. eg. to get small stones you have to mine them with your hook, you can't pick them up (except for the one bit of the story where you have to be able to pick up a stone to continue - if youve put this in the game why only in this one location, why not everywhere) but you can only mine things with your hook if its underwater, which these resources often aren't due to odd generation.- Odd cliched plot, not really too much of an issue by itself but when gameplay fails to intrigue there is no decent plot to captivate interest.- Voice acting sounds like it was done by random people in the office- Most items, including tools just seem like bloatThe game doesn't need new additions, it needs to be redesigned.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 Ocak 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiI wanted to enjoy this game, and honestly gave it a good go, both solo and with friends. For the most part, it's a decent game, except for a few glaring issues that ruin the entire experience. First of all, the save on death feature is a joke. I died several times due to bugs or just weird no clip issues, and lost everything I had due to the devs rabid desire for, ""realism"" in a very unrealistic game. No loading back to when you last saved, (which must be done manually, no autosave) No. The game saves when you die, whether it's to a shark or your raft launching you into a mountain, and you lose your entire inventory. There is no way to get it back unless another player comes and rescues you, which completely ruins the point of a single player experience.Also on the realism note, the food and water demands even on normal are *rediculous.* I wouldn't even mind if food an water was harder to get but lasted longer, because that would be infinitely preferable to having to CONSTANTLY eat and drink. I'm not even joking, the food and water loss rate is absolutely ludicrous, and you end up spending at least half your time just moving rapidly growing crops and watering them, then cooking the food to stay alive. If you're playing with multiple people, then someone is going to get saddled with doing literally nothing but feeding everyone else, and having an oh so fun time of being a potato farmer for many hours, and literally nothing else.All in all, the game itself isn't too bad, but a few bad features ruin it in its entirety. A solid 5/10. As a big fan of survival and sandbox games, this one is just sub par.",N/A

Looking at other reviews, it looks like others would agree as most people have 8 to 10 hours of gameplay.Difficulty:Literally just collecting trash, not hard.AI:The only AI in the game just moves towards you. There is nothing impressive about it.Cutscenes:I don't think there was a single cutscene in the game,Fun:It's awesome first launching the game. You're presented with the world you've likely heard so much and watched so much about. Once you start playing, though, this awe wears off. You collect items, craft things to survive, and collect items. That's... it. I appreciate survival games, but there's nothing to this game and it's just so slow.Sounds/Music:GenericReplayability:Nope nope nope nope. I would never keep playing the survival mode, although I do occasionally hop into the sandbox mode to just mess around.Controls:There's nothing to complain about or praise.

"Yayınlanma: 10 Nisan 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiDon't buy it (yet..?)This game makes very little sense (in a frustrating way), anything that would seem exciting, is a dreadful bland chore..First thing first, the shark, cheap and poor AI, teleports around and moves unnaturally. If you're on your raft, it will eat it away every couple of mins. You can certainly defend your raft, but it's with unsatisfying spear attack animations, and if you manage to ""poke.... poke..... poke.... "" all the three times, it will swim away for a few mins and comes back to eat the raft again.0.00014 seconds you enter the water, your face is being eaten by a teleporting shark, that moves around weirdly, making the battle with it even worse, as if the spear attacks didn't feel horrendous enough. Timing the attacks is hard, but that I forgive, the problem is how long the battle takes, there's practically no indication of a hit or miss, it just stops rubber-banding around (singleplayer), and you can finally sigh in relief and loot it. Litterally a few mins later it has already respawned and attacks you again, BEFORE you returned to your raft from the island you were looting.Next up, crafting, doesn't make any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense.Where would you guess the bed would be placed under? Furniture? Or Chests? Chests of course. Scarecrow is placed under food and water, because reasons. How about the net to catch floating trash? Under the ship tab? No, Chests too!Okay, so now we have tools and weapons, they have durability, but some of them don't, there's no consistency. The hammer has no durability, but the shovel does, and the shovel doesn't even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dig dirt or sand, we still don't know what it's for, we've tried to dig up sand, dirt, stones etc. An island full of sand? You cannot dig that sand up, you need to find a tiny fist-sized pile of sand somewhere AWAY from the sand, and ONLY under water, NOT with a shovel, but with a HOOK, you need a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hook to dig sand up with, clay, ore, everything. What the hell were they thinking? If at all?!And the AXE, oh man, only CERTAIN type of trees can be chopped down, all the logs, and other trees, apparently have no wood. Got mangos? You cannot pick them, you have to chop the trees down.Hunger and thirst: As with many other survival games, this was put in here too. As with almost everything else, with less than fun results. The hunger/thirst bar falls down pretty quickly too. You can run and sprint, which is fine, but the very second your bar hits a certain point, you become a cripple and can only crawl around, your vision gets blurry and you start coughing up a storm, or the stomach start growling loudly in a constant loop. The thirst/hunger mechanic isn't so bad on its own, but combined with your boat being CONSTANTLY eaten away, seagulls CONSTANTLY eating your crops, while you have to figure out how this arbitrary game works, it's not fun.The game is not fun, it has the potential to be, we tried to find it, but it's not there, it feels like a cheap garbage game, with an overwhelming lack of logic involved.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 24 ŞubatRaft is a good game and the only reason Im coming on here to give it a negative review is to give you a little more realistic lense on what to expect.First of all let me say that I think is unplayable alone. Excpet for very tiny fractions there is basically nothing going on and once your survival is guranteed youre just auto piloting. I played the whole game with a friend and it was great, there was enough downtime to talk about other stuff while the game still created some funny moments.You propably already know this from the vibe that game gives off but this game PURLEY EXISTS TO RELAX. If you are looking for great story, exploration or gameplay, you wont find it here.10h into the game I propably would have recommended it with a great review. There is stuff to do, decorate your raft and make sure you can craft the newest item and when a new island appears on the horizont you get excited.But the closer you get to the end, the lamer the game becomes. The greatest moments are bascially the story islands appearing on your screen and you going ""woahhh"" for 5 seconds before you realize that you will have to spend 20 minutes with boring combat and stupid puzzles that are just there to waste your time just to be rewarded with 10 lines of dialogue. While the story islands have some cool enviormental story telling going on, the actual gameplay is so boring that the inital fascination wares off really quick and youre left with nothing. The game throws some new stuff at you for the final islands but honetsly why bother upgrading your raft at that point? The game gives you no motivation or in some cases the possibility to upgrade your equpiment. raft or optimazation of food and water system. The fact that it only takes like 5 to 10 minutes to travel between the last 50% of the islands since you have the necessary engines and there is basically no threat at this point to your survival I really cant see why anybody would spend time engaging with the games new systems unless they are really into the grind/optimizing stuff.The idea was there. But even after all these updates there simply isnt enough to do over the 20-30 hours it requires to finish the game especially with the second half being so much worse than the first one.If you wanna kick back and relax with your friends while playing a fun ocean game, by all means, you will have a good time.  But if you take that aspect away, youre suddenly left with shockingly little.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Ekim 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt's quite fun.  It has potential, but it needs work.In creative mode, you're turning your raft into a palace, but there is no challenge, so that gets old pretty quickly.In the survival mode, you start out on this minute little raft.  You have to collect pieces of flotsam to expand your raft, and collect food, and collect the bits necessary to collect and purify water.  You have perhaps 15 minutes to do all this before you die of thirst.  It's a lot to get through, especially with the annoying shark ready to eat you at every moment.  That shark is REALLY annoying.But the really big problem is the lag, which is infuriating.  Minimizing your settings doesn't help.  You may be underwater, running ourt of oxygen and being eaten by the shark, and there's nothing you can do about this because it takes the system a couple of seconds to respond to anything you do.  The grappling hook you see in the video is totally useless, because by the time its responded to your throw, the item is already well out of range.  I believe you can, in theory, craft a spear to defend yourself against the shark with, but the shark will have killed you before the spear reacts to your mouse click.Some people report that the lag gets worse the bigger your raft gets, so I guess it's less of an issue for some players than for others, but it's still an issue.So you start the game, on this tiny raft, trying to collect the bits that you'll need to survive, but you can't, because of the lag. You can jump into the water to collect the them, but the shark will attack and you can't defend yourself because of the lag.  So you keep respawning yourself again and again (in ""Easy"" mode, you keep the inventory you've built up from one life to another), but you've got so much to collect and do that it's very difficult not dying of thirst in the time that's available.They really need to sort out the memory lag, because as it is, it's almost unplayable.  And they need to extend the time available before you die of thirst.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 8 Ağustos 2022I have had a love hate relationship with this game. I got it in early access before the story. and whilst there was only so much to do. I really enjoyed the chill, isolated vibe. Where you must stay alive and make life comfortable. but as the game has progressed although the story and new stuff for your raft is a welcome addition the chill isolation has descended into a slaughter fest boss battle platformer. After playing half the game of building out your raft, painting it, decorating it and becoming almost self sufficient. The late game drags you into a dystopian mad max. killing spree. as the chapters progress you suddenly get a boss fight then another and another with a platformer in between. who in there right mind wants that after 20 or so hours of painting and farming. and if you do. Do you want to wait for 20 hours of painting and farming to get to your bit of the game. the late game seems so jarringly at odds with the first half. knowing what I know now I don't think I would have bought it in the first place. so all in all a really good survival builder game that loses it's way at endgame.",N/A

Too bad the game goes about this with a boring as hell constant grind for resources, and after you collect those 4 wooden planks you'll realize your character's food and water bars drop like you don't even have any other organs your brain is just flopping around on the floor in the sun. And on top of that one baked potato will fill your hunger bar only enough to last you until the next potato is done cooking.If you're wondering about the other things this game has to offer, there is nothing else at all, that's it, just growing potatoes or beets or whatever and waiting until the friendly shark can put you out of your misery.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Temmuz 2022I have two main thoughts about this game.1)It reminds me of Starbound, but with a much more functional gameplay loop. A very tedious, grindy gameplay loop - but it has one nonetheless. I can see reasons - notgoodreasons, but reasons nonetheless - for even the mostasininemechanics in the game. This is not really a point in the game's favor. It means that things transparently happen because it serves a meta purpose, rather than because it's a natural conclusion of the logic presented.2) This is the single worst excuse for a story I have ever seen in a game.If you choose to pursue the story, you are - much like Starbound - guided to a series of isolated mission locations where you have to disembark your raft and suddenly do a bunch of unrelated things that have nothing to do with the game's core gameplay loop. This starts as basic platforming and evolves into tedious point-and-click gameplay where you have to find key items that allow you to interact with gates, with an occasional puzzle. From there, it goes nowhere. For the rest of the game, that's what you'll be doing. Find a key item, find the gate it goes into. It doesn't matter if the key is shaped like a crowbar, or if the gate is an engine you have to turn on.It actually ventures into the realm of the absurd later on, when at one point you have two doors - one requires ""1 Master Key"", and the second requires ""1 Hammer"". They are secured with identical padlocks and neither are noticeably more secure. You get the hammer first, use it on the door, and smash the lock open.Why can't you bring that hammer back to the Master Key lock and finish the only objective you're here for?God only knows! You can argue from thedesigner'sperspective, of course, but at that point you're arguing with the author and thoroughly out of the fiction itself, which rather defeats the point.I don't mean to harp on the barebones key-gate tedium too much. All things considered, it is one of the game's lesser sins - it's just that hot out of the finale, it's first thing on my mind. Here are some of the other sins:-There will be at no point answers for any of your questionsregarding the world, what happened to it, who the people you meet are, or what the organization you allegedly belong to is or means.-The characters are annoying stereotypes.You only ever get to know them through written notes. You get to meet some of them eventually as NPCs that only serve to dispense a few lines of dialogue.-None of the islands are unique.You will be seeing the same islands over and over andoveragain.-Thirst fast becomes irrelevant,because fresh water is in abundance. This leaves it as an annoyance that demands you carry around a bottle for almost the entire game.-Speaking of annoyances, they compose 90% of the game's structure.Step into the water? You'll get bitten by the immortal shark that follows you around. Kill the shark? He resurrects in around 3-4 minutes. Your dinnerware made of solid clay is consumed along with your meals, which is not for technical reasons as you get your buckets back when you drink milk (unless used for a smoothie) - this is entirely implemented to force you to dig for more clay forever. Because otherwise, clay would be obsolete rather quickly. There's more like this - for example, jars (and therefore glass) get eaten when you turn honey into biofuel. For a game that seems to carry a moral about recycling, you're not really allowed to do much of it.This is a game where you're encouraged to getovermost of these problems, but the solutions rarely solve anything, or just introduce more and worse dependencies. This is in some ways fine - because the developers needed to stretch out what they had for mechanics and a gameplay loop over the entire game - and in other ways infuriating, because it's responsible for most of the unending nuisances, and it means I actuallydreadthe idea of playing the game all over again.""But,"" you ask. ""What about the story? What was so bad about it?""It accumulates to nothing, essentially. That's what. In the end, the world is still a wreck. The caricature of an antagonist that harassed a bunch of off-screen characters in ways you'll only learn about through implausibly-scattered notes and journals left by off-screen characters turns up at the end of the game to gloat about nothing. He leads you through a series of irritating puzzles - most of which can be thankfully cheesed in multiplayer - and then, rather than actually fighting you himself, sics a Glowing One Hyena upon you. That's right, a radioactive mutant hyena, which he proclaims is the pinnacle of ""evolution"".Also, throughout these puzzles, you get plenty of opportunities to land pot-shots on this guy. In fact, one of them involves stacking orange crates and cages on top of each other until you can reach the platform atop which he stands while throwing napalm grenades at you. This is an extremely tedious exercise that involves bunny-hopping around the arena, grabbing boxes, and moving them back over to near his platform, where you stack them up in the form of a set of stairs. Once you make it to the top, you're inevitably between him and the exit, spears and/or bows armed and ready, with nowhere for him to run. He solves this conundrum by phasing directly through you.I didn't realize it until after this happened, but you could have just shot him with a bow from down below, in the arena. Fortunately, I got an opportunity to test this theory whenimmediatelyfollowing the above events, he leads you to a second arena identical to the first, where in addition to the fire-bombing, you get to dance around a pack of respawning hyenas while moving the boxes around. I took the opportunity to send a few metal-tipped arrows through the antagonist's body. I mean, literally through his body - because they phased straight through, no damage, no harm.I am harping on the ludicrous scenarios the game puts you in because the gameplay during these parts is so barebones and tedious that there's hardly anything tosayabout it. You stack boxes, you slide boxes. You spin wheels hooking up cables. There was one genuinely clever puzzle that I feel is worth both complimenting and mentioning: it's to do with an observatory. That one was A+. That was something brilliant that I'd expect to see in a really good adventure game. Which this is, unfortunately, not.I don't recommend Raft, not at full price. Maybe if you got it at a steep discount. It kept leading us on until the end, but if I paid more than $5 for this, I'd feel ripped off. And I, unfortunately, paid $18.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 31 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThere are many reasons as to why I won't recommend Raft to people right now, but don't get me wrong: it is a pretty enjoyable game (for a while) and has potential.The game starts out quite slow, making every discovery feel joyous and worthwhile. You hook some items from the sea, build some space on your raft, find some barrels afloat, your eyes shine, you get some bling bling, everything's cool, right?You find an island, grab all the fruit lying around, maybe chop some wood, dive a bit, mine some materials. It's pretty chill, isn't it?WELL, if you've been playing on pacific or creative, it is very nice. Once you crank things up to normal mode, Raft loses most of it's glimmer. The main reasons:The shark is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying;Food and water are a omnipresent concern;Craftables have unreasonable/ illogical costs;The SharkThe shark is arguably Raft's biggest issue. It spawns alongside you when a new world is created, making it impossible for the player to just jump in the sea and collect some of the floating stuff early on. The problem with that is that it makes gathering resources very time consuming, since you need to rely on the ever so slow plastic hook and it doesn't helps that most craftables feel way too expensive for their efficacy. And worse, should you manage to kill the shark with the painfully slow and expensive wooden spear, it respawns very quickly, giving the player almost no window to do anything they might need to. To take one down, at least 2 wooden spears are needed, but there's still the matter that it's much faster than you in water, so you'll have to rely on waiting for it to bite the raft OR learn how to kite it, by climbing on the raft when it gets close, jump back in to maybe get one hit in, rinse and repeat.HUNGER!Resource management is a must in survival games, that much is acceptable. The issue with Raft, tho, is that food values are completely unbalanced and create a lot of tension instead of making the game enjoyable. There's a watermellon in the game. If eaten whole, it replenishes less than one fifth of the hunger bar. Ate an entire fish? Still hungry. The only reliable recovery rates are for liquids, which actually do quench the player's thirst. Even so, Food and Water bars deplete so fast it quickly becomes a chore to manage those. It could be that they serve as masking mechanics to slow down the game's pace and disguise the distinct lack of content in Raft, but it ruins the experience for many all the same.CraftingCrafting in Raft is simple and intuitive. You gather a bunch of materials, bundle them together and a new item is born. The problem is, the costs are unreasonable or just dont make sense. The primary tool, the plastic hook, costs Wood and Plastic, but no Rope. The wooden spear, costs a whooping 8 Wood (items only stack to 20) and 3 Rope (???). Although I'm not going to reference them all, that pattern persists through much of the game's recipes, forcing the player to go on resource hunts constantly. Don't even get me started on how slow cooking and smelting is, which means you'll have to strap like 10 smelters to your raft if you want to cover most of the equipment expenses (which wear down pretty fast, btw).ConclusionDon't bother buying the game unless it's on a good discount OR if you don't mind being constantly pressured to play the game a certain way ( normal and hard difficulties). As charming as it can be, the lack of content and balance quickly take away the fun from it. The only way to remedy that for now is mods.",N/A

One of the animations for an attack for the last boss is so bad(think 5 nights at freddy's animatronics motions on what is supposed to be a live animal????) I felt like closing the game right then and there(especially after watching the last boss jump down to my level by ""popping up, sliding forward, and dropping down"" with basically no model animation , and the writing was TERRIBLE (I know writing good story is hard, but this is just ""the MAN=bad"", silly drivel often used by irrational people use to explain why they don't get ahead when their own decisions lead them to the place they stand. Silly drivel usually makes a bad storyline for anyone smart enough not to drown themselves in it.)The LOW durability of the tools is very annoying and DRAAAAAGGGGS the grind out horribly(drove me to modding the game by the time I got to Tangaroa)Mango and Coconut seeds drop at ~60% to ~75%, meaning your tree farm will dwindle rather quickly, Not dropping the seed and having an option to harvest the seed from the fruit would have dropped the unnecessary grind.At the end, you will have to load mods if you don't enjoy the grind (didn't know this was an MMO living off of my playtime....) for materials JUST to keep up on tool durability, (building the raft takes quite a bit too, and don't build raft parts in the wrong place.... you lose half taking it back down)Spoiler time?:A platforming section in a game that hangs the character up on little details of the walls and terrain?? also the HUGE delay between crouching and change in the character hitbox??? WTF Maybe a small delay but not several seconds.TITANIUM TOOLS at the END!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????????? you made me grind so much for materials to keep my metal tools going in the first place I have explored everything to boredom ALREADY... REALLY!!!??? At the end the only thing left to do is mess with your raft......",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 8 Temmuz 2022Right now it feels like a wanna-be story-driven adventure game that tries too hard and forgets it is supposed to be a survival game where you pick up random items floating around your raft.The building part is fun, and picking up stuff is fun, but then there's this over-scaled story that is physically vast, empty, boring, and has nothing to do with the basic mechanics or even the game's name. Should there be a need for stories, a variety of smaller events/quests, even text-based ones, within that gameplay be a way better experience, in my opinion.That alone, as much as I enjoy chilling on my raft, I couldn't recommend this game to people looking for survival or adventure games, for now anyway, as there seem to be more updates to come as far as I know.As mentioned, I do enjoy the actual rafting, even if it's just picking up stuff and building, with a weird fishing trading mechanic. It has its moments, but I recommend playing with a group of friends or picking up some mods to better enjoy where the game should shine at this stage.Maybe future updates could bring some of the elements I craved;  catching the everchanging flow of wind and water with my raft's sail and rudder, traveling and trading between locations and rafters, helping them while benefiting myself as I explore the endless ocean and islands, picking up items floating around to keep me afloat, further perfecting the raft I build, and so on.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 28 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI'm just starting out but it is off to a frustrating start. The only reason I'm hanging in there is because of all the positive reviews, giving me hope that it gets better once I get a handle on everything.FIrst time I start, I am starving but I do have a watermelon. Now, how do I eat it? Double click? Right click? Maybe select and hold E? Second time around I get it: you have to actually equip it first, then eat it.I get on my first island but I'm not sure what to expect because I heard the raft may float away. So I save before I hop off. Raft indeed floats away, I die trying to get to it (thanks shark). Apparently the game saves on death or something? So my intentional save to prevent exactly this scenario, is gone.I restart into a new game, my boat gets stuck on the first island and I haven't gathered enough resources to craft a paddle or sail. I have to dodge the shark while I swim around to gather enough resources, combined with the save-on-death you can imagine how fun this is.I'm starving and very thirsty, I build the water purifier thing, I put in water with the cup, wait a bit and go back. I put the cup in front of it and it just says ""pick up"". Pick up what? The water? Sure, let's do that. O crap, it picks up the entire purifier. Sigh. Better start again.The shark bites off part of my raft, there is no indication if and how I can repair this, google informs me it is the middle click on the hammer. Google also mentions it takes planks to repair. How many? I'm still not sure as off this writing.I have seeds to plant watermelons and I can craft a planting thing. I fail to read the small print in the description saying the watermelon only fits into the medium planter, not the small planter. There is however no feedback of this as I try to jam the watermelon seed into the planter. The thing is, there is no interaction at all, which makes you wonder (like with the watermelon): am I doing it wrong? Do I need to hold it differently? Hit some magical combination of buttons or mouse keys? Point my mouse at a specific part of the planter?I spawn into an existing world, the ocean is entirely empty, there is nothing to pick up. I assume this is a bug?Every time I load my single player game I have to re-select ""no friends"" just so I can actually pause the game when life intervenes. How hard can it be to simply remember the last setting?I'm really hoping I still have to get to the fun bit, but I can definitely say that the game is not friendly to newcomers. The game explains nothing and is not intuitive enough to make up for that lack of explanation.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 Aralık 2018Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiMeh... could be a lot better.Controls could be better (mainly the exiting out of water part), content is sub-par, difficulty is forced, yet still easy, no tutorial or guidance on how to do certain not-so-obvious things like collecting stuff under water. Currently only worth buying while on a heavy sale.For the record, what I mean by forced difficulty is that the game forces you to eat and drink so much and constantly collect so much debris on the water that you don't even get the oppertunity to enjoy the (unfortunately) blank scenery / take a moment of break. The second you fall into the water, the shark is  almost garanteed to get a strike on you which is really dumb and annoying. I would rather see the shark do much more damage per strike but have a far less chance of striking right away than to have a shark that strikes you every single time you touch the water for like 3 seconds. And I don't know if they did this on purpose or not, but trying to get out of the water is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying, the controls feel like they're not at all responsive, you constantly get hung up under the raft instead of climbing / jumping onto it. It just seems like the devs couldn't come up with a good balance in difficulty, so they just forced it with nonsense.Also, what's with the debris spawning in a straight line? If I go in another direction using the sail, debris stops spawning completely... so debris in our oceans are like rivers, going only in a straight line? Makes no sense.Years ago, I got a refund for this game, then I bought it again another year later hoping things improved and played with my sister... I still regret it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 9 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiFirst of all, ignore my down-vote. Ive recommended this game to my friends, its an enjoyable, refreshing game and worth every cent . Go play it.It has a great  soundtrack to go with the 'lost at sea' vibe and you can almost smell the ocean as you drift around on your boat with a blood-thirsty shark to keep you company.I just have one tiny gripe.Once you get to the main islands, the game goes from a sandbox feel, to a linear quest style scenario that I personally detest in games. Eg: In order to go through this door you need a key. To get a key , you first have to find a crowbar that opens up a locker. To get the crowbar, you first have to find a note. Once you open the door with the key, then you have to go back to the start and get a hammer you need.... etc etc.The quest part isnt terrible - its well implemented and fits the storyline and I know a lot of people will love it- but not me- and my mum says Im special so you have to believe me.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 12 Temmuz 2022I know people will fight me on this. But the process of gameplay from start to finish is weird so hear me out. So basically you start on a small raft and have to gather resources yes of course! But as you go along you must struggle to improve the raft and gain more momentum so the struggle becomes less. Great so far! Ok so the issue that makes me lost on gameplay or directive is this, the basic blueprints like, sprinklers,purifier,engine,charger,pipes,biofuel,beehives are all behind the story points of interest. So during most of the game you are set to the basic primitive struggle items with  no means to refine the materials to further the raft. So most people have a horribly built raft with basic needs for food/water/storage only to hold out for the normal item blueprints set to the story. So you mostly are set to speedrun/rush for the storyline and skip out on the slow roleplay run. Why build a primitive base before the blueprints to fit the base. Once you have all those things for that raft and can finally build a proper raft...the game is over, no more story, nothing to work for, so why contiune? Sure many will say just relax and play the game slow and not rush the story...but you HAVE TO for the basic blueprints. Why go to big not story islands for materials you cant really use. They should had the blueprints be random where if you travel to large islands you could find 1 useful blueprint. Which incentives  exploration away from the storyline thus making the gameplay last longer. Aright so then if they change that why would you need the stroyline, well you could have even higher end stuff like the titanium gear and more roleplay build/items, extra cool things that wont affect early gameplay . Like Minecraft where yes you could stop at diamond gear, but with some hard work and grinding you can get nether stuff which is way better then diamond. IDk the game is great but I hate how the momentum dies the second you finish the story.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 9 Eylül 2022Steam really needs to implement a ""Mixed"" option on if one would recommend the game. Because when it comes to Raft, Mixed is definitely where I lie.Early Access (chapters 1 & 2) would have originally put this at a ""Yes"". The gameplay loop was rather straightforward - maintain food/water and gather supplies/advance tech while not getting eaten by the persistent shark that's floating around your raft. There was just enough in that early-mid part of the game where you were spinning plates before you were able to stabilize. There were places to go along the way that pushed forward a narrative (whoopsie humanity had some global warming and f---ed it all up!) while giving you new tools to advance to the next area. Combat wasn't necessarily the game's strong point, but it also was not a hard requirement to continue. The first boss that was introduced had a mechanic that allowed you to bypass the fight as long as you explored the island and figured it out. Death definitely felt a bit on the heavy handed side but could be mitigated. I managed to finish Tangaroa before finding out that the third chapter was on hiatus.Then Chapter 3 released, which set this game back a bit:Caravan Town and Tangaroa were the first place where the devs started flirting with platforming, but this became an actual pain in the ass come the final segments of the game.Boss fights went from optional to required. The second boss became incredibly painful if you did not have some flippers and breathing tools stockpiled. The third is spread across three fights, with no indication on how exactly you're supposed to proceed, and could be much more easily resolved if you could put an arrow in their head from the start. In the end, these fights served to highlight just how poor combat was in this game.The narrative of the entire game was rewritten to change a certain character from chapter 1 from inept to the main bad guy, while also burying the separate plot of chapter 1's radio tower into a subplot that is left hanging come late chapter 3. Newer players may not have a problem with this, but as someone from Early Access, this shoehorning was irreconcilable.The last boss fight rewards a power tier for all of your tools, but at that point in the game you have nothing to use them on. What good is fighting the very last major boss fight of the game, only to be given your best tools afterwards? This makes it feel like chapter 3 was in fact cut short.It's understandable that chapter 3 was developed during the pandemic and that there should be some flexibility in when/how they deliver, but it was obvious when this chapter released that the developers just wanted to move on to a new game or IP. It's a shame that this game started with a strong premise but could not stick the landing.",N/A

Losing gear is understandable, but the game automatically saving the moment you die is frustrating as there is a lot in this game that is unknown and has to be discovered the hard way, so with the current system there's no way to make an attempt at something, fail/die, then try it again without you having to spend lots of time gathering materials again, making the gear you need again just to get back to the point you died, and then make the attempt again. This type of system doesn't create a challenge, it doesn't make the game pleasantly difficult, it simply wastes the player's time. If this system were improved I would definitely recommend this game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Temmuz 2022In a nutshell, this game starts off having you hooked, but gets incredibly boring at an exponential rate. It has a couple of cool features, but is SEVERELY lacking in content for being a ""complete game"". Even playing with friends can get boring. Once you get a significant amount of progress in the game, you will find yourself just pointlessly drifitng and gathering resources you don't need. This is to be expected with any survival game, but it happens in this game MUCH faster than any survival game I have played. The music can start to get really annoying and repetitive, the combat starts to get really annoying and repetitive, the atmosphere starts to get really.... You get it.

"Yayınlanma: 28 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiImagine creating a survival game that has solved a great number of problems that have existed in survival games by adding things like direction, and lore that the player discovers incidentally through playing, like on that one island where some kid tried to find livable space beneath the ocean and fails, but then instead launches his family into space. Did you meet this kid? No. You read his books. Because it was interesting.Now imagine that you've built this series of relatively interesting mechanics with dozens of hours of gameplay, but you add a death mechanic so bad that everything you've collected is lost to the ether because the janky-ass rodent AI glitched through a wall and murdered you while you're on your way back to your raft so you can boil yet more water.This is that game. ♥♥♥♥ this game.",N/A

Any shark, anywhere in the world, would leave the raft alone after realising the effort involved to get a meal out of it - it's just not worth their time and they would leave before they starve to death trying to munch through a wooden raft.There is also no real, meaningful story content in the game, you can do a few things but as far as a story goes it's incredibly basic, so playing solo is almost pointless.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 24 Şubat 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft has been in early access for nearly two years now, but ""These things, they take time"" -Gabe NewellFrom all the update logs that have been coming out, it looks like the developers really do care about this game and I hope they continue to work on it until it meets its release date. Raft does have a hard competitor when it comes to a ""water survival game"" considering that Subnautica had the full release out of early access on Jan 2018, while four months after, Raft came out for early access in May 2018, being overshadowed by the super popular Subnautica.I very much like the game and I like the concept of making my raft out of floating trash from the ocean. The survival portion is fun when you start out on a small raft but gets increasingly more boring as the game progresses. After finding all the islands/facilitiesand sailing around for awhile, I found myself organizing my trash more than anything else and killing the seagulls that were attacking my scarecrows.Would I recommend it? For now, no I wouldn't. I would wait awhile and see what direction the developers take their game.If you have the money to buy this game and to support the developers, then go for it.

"Yayınlanma: 9 Ağustos 2022I absolutely loved this game in Early Access. I did two full playthroughs (and a YT series) and was so impressed by the sense of adventure and the unique POIs that were in the game. The story was engaging and the world was beautiful (the concept behind the game and the story of its development is so cool). There were issues with it (combat was janky, jumping wasn't great - especially as you have no sense of placement with your feet, and hunger/thirst was a bit on the aggressive side) but the adventure/story/art style/uniqueness made up for it.Even though 1.0 adds some very interesting POIs and changes to the story in a unique way, their concepts don't meet up with what is within the framework of the game. They added boss fights which are completely broken. You can be right on top of the enemy and hits won't register, enemies can attack you and hit you from 2-3 feet away from where they actually are and they can attack you through hardcover/high above. It feels incredibly broken.Also, the death penalty for solo players is the harshest I have ever seen in a survival game (and not in a good /challenging way). They will destroy 2/3 of your inventory and knock down the durability of all of your tools by 50%. It makes it so it wastes hours of work and you then have to grind several hours more to make up for it.In the end, they have some cool concepts but it feels like they started to create one game and decided to switch gears in the end to another type of game. It feels out of place, janky, and overly frustrating to those that are playing solo. It hurts me to say this as I loved this game but the end direction just wasn't the right way of going about this and ruins the overall experience. If you are into creative mode (building without worrying about survival elements) I would recommend jumping into the game for this but otherwise, I cannot recommend the game in the current state.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Ağustos 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is really cool and a fresh take on survival games. My problem with it though is how rough around the edges it is. One big problem for me is how after you kill the shark, how quickly a new one comes back, and it is NOT easy to kill in the early game, and then it comes back in a quarter of the time it took for you to stab it to death with a wooden spear.Another annoying bug is when the shark just swims through land or objects. I reinforced my outer edge of my raft to see how it would work, but the shark just glitches through it and attacks all the non-reinforced pieces instead. That's beyond frustrating because the reinforcements are not cheap. When things like this happen and instead of attacking your raft, it glitches through and attacks you, after barely escaping either the shark or other animals and kills you, that just ruins the entire experience for me (EDIT: This glitch with the shark seems to be patched as of the ""The Second Chapter"" update) . If you could drop a backpack when you die to get your items or something then it would be okay, but you can't, and with how slow and passive gathering resources is and losing any valuables you had on you, requiring 15-30 minutes of sitting on your raft waiting for your nets to gather materials is not fun.And now about the material grind. Any survival game has this, but most limit you by if you can find resource nodes or how long you're willing to spend exploring before coming back to your HQ. Here, you just sit. That's it. Little interaction. Sure you have your hook to grab single or multiple materials if you can get them to line up, and a barrel once in awhile, but most the time you're just waiting on your collection nets to stack up with materials. If you decide to ever change directions though using your sail, you'll have to wait a couple minutes before the game figures that out and start spawning more materials in your path to run into. Having waiting be a mechanic for no good reason, as compared to waiting for food/trees to grow or the time to travel between destinations because you're sailing and not teleporting makes sense. But waiting just so new material will spawn before you have to wait even longer before your raft can run into them is just a really boring loop that is kind of at the core of the game.The game is a really cool concept, unique, I'm sure is very fun with friends, but as a solo experience it is just miserably slow and grindy, with waiting being tied to the core resource grind. The combat is clunky and slow and times you feel like you hit something, you just didn't, and you have to wait for the slow animation to finish before attacking again, which is the same long animation whether you miss or hit something. If this game gets polished up, these small bugs that actually ruin the experience get patched, and the resource spawning being able to adapt to your ship direction so you aren't waiting even longer to gather them, then this game would be 9/10 for me. Currently, I'd give it 3/10 as a solo experience. With a group though, I could see it being like 6/10 though.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 10 ŞubatSorry, this is a really fun game, but it's far too punishing when you die in single player.  Not only do you lose 2/3 of your inventory permanently, but you also lose a great deal of durability on your inventory that you get to keep (which isn't stated).The autosave feature is really horrible in that it saves as you die, so you don't get to try and do something different; you're stuck incapacitated.  It's extremely frustrating to the point to where it just isn't fun to play because you either have to explore nearly naked, or limit your exploration overall if you like to keep your gear on you (you *will* die eventually).This totally sucks - it really is fun gameplay, but the punishment for dying in single player is just too much.  I can't recommend as a single player game; it may be great as multi-player.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Aralık 2019Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiMy problems with the game:- Extremely poor performance on my machine. Even after reducing render quality.- The game just dumped me into an environment without any clue, context or basics for how to do anything in the game.- Once I figured out how to use the hook, which wasn't trivial given that most of the time I threw the hook out, nothing happened, it was only by chance that I finally snagged something.- Even after learning how to use the hook, pickups were less than 1 out of 10 throws because the hook in would always either fall short of whatever I was trying to snag, or end up beyond than what I was trying to snag thus when reeling in the hook would fall behind what I was trying to snag.- A shark attacked my raft and the only thing I had was a hook and as far as I can tell it did nothing. The game provided no hints as to how to deal with a shark, so my expectation is that if I could never snag anything useful I would eventually lose the starting raft. Additionally, if I ever did manage to build anything, having to continuously rebuild what the shark destroys just makes the shark a pointless time waster.- My raft encountered an island, I hopped onto the island to look around and my raft disappeared. Then after I presume the raft sailed away from the island far enough, the island itself disappeared dumping me in the middle of nowhere with nothing around me and no hints as to what to do next.- After getting dumped in the middle of nowhere, I found a menu option to get some help. The option took me out of the game to some website and by that point I had enough and quit after 19 minutes.All in all, I didn't find this game fun, the performance was awful, and all the mechanics seem to just want to waste my time. The game doesn't even seem to be all that difficult, it just doesn't lend itself to be played by people who have a passing interest in it due to it's mechanics being fully opaque. If I really cared, I could probably go look up tips on how to play the game, but I wasn't having fun and getting dumped into the middle of nowhere without any clues as to what to do next basically killed any further interest I potentially could've had.Refund requested.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 10 NisanWhen this game was in early access it was controller supported but now that it is finished it is not, which does not make any sense why they would remove this ability. So looks like I won't be playing the game any longer. Unless you like playing with a key board and mouse I wouldn't recommend.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 17 Nisan 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiAs a general rule of thumb, $1 for every hour played. I spent $20 on the game and didn't reach 20 hours before I am throwing in the towel. There just isn't enough to do in the game. You have to spend waaaay too long throwing hooks out for base materials, although the nets help a little (BUT NOT ENOUGH!). The building aspect is entertaining to a degree, but the material payout for highly used items (such as wood planks) doesn't warrant the work needed. As others have said, many of the islands look alike, and what trees you do come across (or grow) don't pay out anywhere what's needed to really get enjoyment out of the game. It feel more like a 2nd job just trying to far planks to grow your raft. The receiver was nice, better than floating aimlessly to find an island to visit. Food and water degrade waaaay too quickly, so it seemed like I was always having to refill, which meant fishing. If I wasn't fishing, I was drinking, and then gathering wood, then fishing, ooo then an island, but dang now I gotta eat, because god help you if you're on the wrong side of a big island and your water/food level drop below the caution line (character moves like a slug).The shark mechanic was entertaining at first, and it was a challenge (even after upgrading weapons) to kill it, but the work was not worth the 3-5 minutes reprieve that you get once you kill it. There is a seemingly endless amount of sharks mere minutes apart that only come when their buddy dies. Diving is a complete pain in the butt if there is a shark up, and it was easier and more efficient to have 1 person bait the shark, while the other person dives for the loot underwater around the island. I think it would have been better if shark attacks were random, not 1 shark circling your raft for weeks on end just to annoy you once you get in the water... idk.Sigh, I know it just seems like I'm rambling at this point, but the game just felt like more work than fun, and we only played on medium difficulty. If not playing with a friend, I doubt I would have even made it to 17 hours. I love builder/survival games (as my nearly 600 hours in ARK will show), but I would not recommend this unless it was on a super sale.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 28 OcakThe idea behind this game looks so fun, but the controls are atrocious. After close to two hours of playing, I still had issues. Ugh and everything is so tedious! Especially when it comes to food/water. Also why do I need to eat like 5 potatoes and I'm still starving to death only walking like half a mile. This is the most unrealistic survival game I've ever played. You spend more time feeding yourself than you do anything else. Like maybe the game gets easier as you make more tools, but either way, why would I want to, through first impressions, play a really hard game that actually gets easier? The organization of inventory is also a pain. If you want something like this game, but better, play Valheim.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 OcakÜrünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiPersonally, this game really only works for Multiplayer I assume. I bought this game for the reason of me liking games where its more so survival and building focused without relying on cheats and the sort, so I like Minecraft and I also love Stardew Valley. I thought Raft may have been an inbetween as I seen a lot of people depict it that way, but in this case resource management has a lot to do with this game, and I played on Normal and Easy difficulty by myself for about 45 minutes each  in order to get a feel for the game. And that feeling I got was despair and stress, which is definitely understandable given the scenario of the game, global warming flooding the world, leaving only icecaps and islands that got to be like the UK when Doggerland went under the sea but to the world. The stress in the early game is not very fun and on normal, even less so when you are alone. For the time being I refunded my game, this was just to unfun being alone which I prefer singleplayer so that worsened things. I really wanted to like this game but I couldn't, I do want to return to it one day but for the time being I got my money back and that will likely go to another game during the next sale on Steam as I was planning to use it for Fallout 76 but I was a day late.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 28 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiDifficulty is based around how long you can stay alive without water and food. I feel that is a mistake. Survival need the aspect of that sure, but from hard to easy there is 26 minutes difference. I don't want to just stand on a raft drinking water constantly. I put it on hard to have sharks all around me, where a mistake can kill me. Not where i just have to constantly drink and eat.Building your raft feels slow, too slow. The plastic cost's should be 1 instead of 2. Again, i spend soo much time on drinking on hard, i don't have time to improve on my raft. Most of my resources goes to repairing from shark attacks. Tedious and horrible design.That being said, the game can become great, if the worlds come alive. For now, the sea is as alive as a glass of water.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Temmuz 2022""Meh"" is what it ended up being at 1.0. If you are the kind of person who plays survival games and enjoys finding and optimizing ways to beat the odds, this is not what they ended up making.The initial game loop is somewhat unique and interesting. Resources pass you by and you have to balance collection, survival and development. However you get over that hump very quickly. There are upgrades you can pursue, but they are kind of meaningless and redundant. Once you have a basic raft, you are set, which is weird since the game was initially about raft survival.Then you get to ""explore"" islands you come across to gather more advanced resources to build more advanced tools and weapons that help you explore said islands. Similar to the raft situation above, you get to metal tools quite quickly, then stay with them till the end of the game, so that exploration is only meaningful a few times. Everything you do is balanced on the side of draining your resources, so you actually feel punished by exploring too much, like you didn't get anything worthwhile out of your trip. You just come back and need to remake the same set of tools that broke down super fast. Basically, you get a better outcome by minimizing exploration. And you are not missing out since all islands are the same.Finally you have the ""main story"". I guess they decided the game was no longer about raft survival, but is now about seeking out other rafters to save them from the overtly evil man who captured them, but being doggy about it because there is no credible way to tell that story. So instead of having more complexity and depth on the raft building side, you get more awkward puzzles and clunky fights.It's a shame we won't see the initial concept be developed more.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 ŞubatI've had my fun with this game playing with my partner, but ultimately I can't recommend it as a ''good game''. This game feels unfinished from beginning to end and most, if not all the gameplay elements found in it are half-baked and wonky. It really is the accumulation of a lot of small things that are meh that makes this game kinda bad:1. They added mechanics like fighting, platforming and even driving in the game, but those are some of the most unpolished and broken mechanics I've seen in gaming in a long time and yet you are forced to use them to progress in the game. The platforming is especially frustrating near the end of the game.2. Most of the puzzles you need to solve are tedious instead of clever and they get annoying fast. While it adds artificial longevity to the game, it doesn't add any fun to it.3. The story/characters in general are so generic you could skip it all of it and not miss much.4. The fun parts of the game are building the raft, catching animals and upgrading equipment, though to do that you need to grind through a lot of repetitive material gathering and island exploration.5. There is not a lot of variety when it comes to islands, so once you've found your first couple of big islands, the novelty wears off really fast.6. The level design in general is not great. You will find yourself walking around in circles a lot searching for what to do and where to go next because the environment gets bigger and more repetitive with each new location you visit, but it often does a bad job of highlighting where you need to go.7. This all amounts to personal tastes, but I find the game aesthetically unappealing in general. From the extremely low resolution and inconsistent textures, to the sharp and glitchy lighting, to the sheer emptiness of the environments and the ocean, to the character and prop designs, every visual aspect of the game feels low quality and placeholder.TL;DR This is one of the games I regret buying in early access because it feels like it never left that state and what was served as a ''final'' product was not very satisfying and half-baked at best. There IS fun to be found in that game, especially when playing along with friends, but I can't recommend it on the basis that it is by all means an unpolished, buggy and unfinished product and it seems as if it will stay that way forever...",N/A

The inventory management never ends because you can't stop gathering supplies.

It's still got a bit of a slow start, but once you get out from the beginning stages, the game becomes a lot more enjoyable that it first was when I originally reviewed it.

"Yayınlanma: 15 OcakOkay, so there's grinding and then there's Raft grinding. I hate Raft grinding. I'm down to chop a thousand trees, fish for an entire real life day, etc to survive and grind my character up to my satisfaction, but in Raft you're stuck on a raft and most of these items float towards you at an excruciatingly slow pace. And then any islands you land on have a very limited supply of material that you can harvest, so you're forced to go to multiple islands a lot. This artificially introduces scarcity and a wait time in between gathering materials that feels very inorganic.Overall good concept, but the forced pace of grinding kills it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 NisanA promising title that is riddled with bugs and performance issues.When you load up Raft you feel the promise of its seemingly endless world sweep over you. So much to explore, so much freedom to build as you wish.  The game has a nice soft art direction that isn't too resource hungry so it runs fairly smoothly (at least to start). It has a lot of nice decorative options. There are only a handful of basic resources so it's easy to understand what you need to collect and how to go about doing that. It has some cool set pieces and some interesting items you can build (zip lines, net launchers etc). The more you play it though, the more its faults become apparent.The grind to collect even the basic things you need to build, quickly becomes a real problem. Good luck ever having enough iron arrows and constantly being on the grind to keep them stocked.  Taking advantage of the thing most people are here for, building a really cool raft, requires so so SO much planks. You need planks, and lots of them, for everything you build. Chests, walls, floors, foundations. But you’ll also need them for weapons, ammo, tools, and many types of consumables. You’ll have hundreds of other basic resources like Palm fronds and plastic sitting around in chests and still be starved for planks. You’ll cover your raft in trees just to farm planks and still be starved for them. You’ll build a ridiculously long trash collecting line of collection nets and still not have enough planks.  That there’s no resource converter (at least not without mods), or no way to build plastic walls or something or plastic versions of things, is a real shame.The shark attacks very frequently, constantly tearing away at your boat because IDK I guess sharks eat boats.  It also CONSTANTLY attacks you without mercy whenever you hit the water. I appreciate a sense of danger, but getting attacked this often is just annoying. You can make some shark bait which kind of works for a short while (kind of because it sometimes ignores bait). You can kill the shark, but another one spawns quickly after so you're more likely to just ignore it and deal with the health loss. Even when you're doing things right to distract or kill the pest it’s always right back in your face.  It’s stifling. No wonder there are multiple mods to turn the damn thing off or greatly change its behavior.  Some of the same issues apply to other enemies, like the screecher that drops rocks on your head incessantly and is so difficult to kill most players don't even know you CAN kill it. It isn't the sort of challenge that’s fun, it’s just frustrating.  It doesn't feel dangerous, the shark or the screecher, it just feels mean.Compounding the issue with some of the animals like the shark, the screecher, and boars, the game relies heavily on combat.  The story sections are full of combat) but the combat is shallow, repetitive, and has poor feedback so you're never really sure how effective you are or even if the game is registering if you're hitting until the thing your attacking finally goes down. I’m not sure why so many survival games think they need some kind of combat in it to be interesting or fun or interesting. I suspect it’s ‘easy’ to make a character swing or stab or shoot and make that attack register and assign every one HP, but in Raft it isn't engaging or rewarding. You’ll enjoy killing the shark the first few times and appreciate the shark steaks until you realize it’s just better to grow some of your food, it’s quick, and you get a lot back for the minimal time commitment.While we’re on the subject of combat, there are only 3 classes of weapons in the game. Spear, sword, and bow. The pinnacle of these is the titanium version of those weapons. It all feels kind of weird though to be building net launchers and net canisters (Which use a type of gunpowder BTW), antenna and radios made with handmade circut boards, engines and automatic sprinklers with timers and batteries but the best I can do is a spear and a bow?  It feels like they (the devs) want you to hunt boar and shark, but they didn't give you good enough tools, let alone fun ones, or enough of a reward to make it worthwhile.The tech tree doesn't really make sense. It’s nice to research things and unlock tech that way, but you can learn to build circuit boards within the first few minutes of the game before you’ve even figured out how to make a bow and arrow.  In fact, building a circuit board with my freaking hands is one of the easiest things to do compared to something you might think would be easy like a big box to put things in. The tech tree doesn't feel very rewarding because you can't use most of the stuff you unlock when you unlock it. I unlocked a net launcher very early, built it, then found out it would be hours before I could build the ammunition for it.  What's the point of getting access to a projectile that I can build now if I can't make the ammo for it?There’s a lot of technology locked behind story islands. This game presents itself as open world survival, but it’s really more linear than that, requiring you to go from story island to story island to find all the macguffins (some of which are very easy to miss even when you know what you're looking for).  While you're at those story islands you have to go through them usually on a set path rather than finding your own way around. You might think a game about building things would let you build things to get past puzzles or obstacles, but not so. You’ll find yourself platforming, doing combat, and doing basic switch puzzles. You won't find yourself using the tools the game gives you to do any kind of puzzle solving.  Between story islands you can float around aimlessly collecting trash, building, and outfitting yourself,  but there will always come a point where you can't progress and need to go finish another story island.Mods go a long way to improving Raft, but this is a review for the game not the community support of the game. However I’ll touch on mods a little bit.  The mod scene for this is very active and there are a lot of high quality mods out there. There is no steam workshop or official mod support, so finding loading and using Mods is unintuitive and it will be a little scary for most people. Many of the mods improve and fix the game in ways that baffle me as to why some of this stuff isn't in the game like the ability to pull items from nearby chests when crafting, an alarm to help you keep track of where the shark is, better animal behavior, more and varied types of walls/roofs/foundations, more and varied weapon types, better tech trees that makes more sense and so on..In short, Raft is a game with a lot of promise. It’s pleasant on the eyes, and it presents some nice if ultimately basic systems. It gets bogged down by its own bugs and some really weird design decisions. It’s approachable, but it doesn't respect the player's time, requiring a lot of grinding for the most basic or resources to do the most basic of things.  There are a lot of game breaking bugs, like the most recent one I ran into where my world completely stopped spawning all floating resources (planks, plastic, crates, palm leaves). I want to like this game, but I can't recommend it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 4 ŞubatI don't understand how this game has so many rave reviews, even from just the preview video and what I experienced of this game I would have to say that there are so many games with better exploration, better building, and better sailing experiences than this piece of hot mess where all that is locked behind some infuriatingly repetitive 'fishing'-type mechanic (though I'm even loathe to call it that base on how many other games I've seen better implementations of fishing in them!). Gathering basic resources is horrific in this game, and I understand there are methods for automating some or all of that later on, but there was no way I was going to put myself through the hell of getting to that point.  I've played games with repetitive core tasks before, this one is not even close to livable.Everything else I saw of the very early game seemed still highly 'early access' and not a polished or finished game, the rolling sea was so bland and featureless it instantly gave two people who had never been sea sick in their lives terrible sea sickness.   The preview video of the game looks very exciting and in-depth but this game presents an EXTREMELY negative experience in the first 25 minutes, and I didn't see any a way that any of those experiences were falling away later on - maybe they'd get covered up a bit with extra mechanics, but it just seemed like it would be a continuously hellish experience going forwards.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ağustos 2022Raft is an... interesting game to say the least, it does something interesting that a lot of these other open world survival crafting games really don't do, and that is, having a constant moving base. A concept that seems interesting and enjoyable at first, until you start to notice the cracks in the execution that spread to other parts of the game, but first let's discuss the raft issue.You start with a small raft, a base if you will, and if you lose sight of it, you pretty much are screwed and have to start the game over. You can't build a new ""raft"" even if you have all the parts you would theoretically need. You can expand your raft, but need to be a build new one? Nope that's not possible.That's the first issue I have with this game, if your raft gets lost or destroyed, that's it, game over.So play carefully, you don't just randomly abandon your raft and you make sure to keep sight of it and also either fight the shark(s) off from destroying it and make repairs as they are needed.Not so bad right? Well, take a look bottom left corner of your screen, hold on a minute you're starving and thirsty, but you just started the game, what's going on?! This is the second (and arguably the biggest issue) of the game, your character seems to have one of the fastest metabolisms in the world it seems as if you aren't constantly stuffing your face with both food and water, you'll start to feel the effect (and if you let it go down far enough, you'll start to lose health and then eventually ""pass out"").Now, I can understand the thirst part, you're on the open ocean, and the sun is beating down on your head, and with no shelter really to start off with, it makes sense that you could become dehydrated pretty quickly. (Of course I would assume at night the temperature cooling down would slow your thirst, but it doesn't) But the hunger? It just feels off.Now according to the Wiki, all modes have a base hunger loss rate of 0.09 seconds, which is then multiplied by a certain amount depending on the difficulty setting. The following list shows the time it takes for a full hunger bar to reach empty based on each difficulty:- Peaceful/Easy: 30 minutes, 52 seconds- Normal: 18 minutes, 31 seconds- Hard 14 minutes, 15 seconds.This would be fine, if it didn't feel like a grind, because let's face it, you gotta keep acquiring food, whilst also boiling salt water,  fighting off sharks from your raft, exploring the water around islands to find materials to build things to research to be able to make progress.New players, are going to have a hell of a bad time on normal difficulty, hell even easy is difficult because of this. Oh and don't forget to boil the water before drinking, because if you don't (let's say you misclick because it happens) your thirst is emptied out almost immediately.Oh and exploration in the water? Yeah good luck doing that outside of peaceful mode, your ass is gonna keep getting eaten by sharks.But let's say you're an expert, you enjoy the grind, you manage to build a damn good raft, and you make progress in the story. Well good luck with the platforming nonsense they've added to it as well. Platforming with jank-ass physics and controls, I'm sure that'll go well for you.Don't get me wrong, after adding mods to it, to slow down hunger and thirst, and playing on peaceful mode, I actually enjoyed the game. The problem is, I shouldn't have had to do that, I should've been able to play the game without worrying every 10 seconds whether I was going to die from hunger or thirst.On paper, the idea for this game is perfect, it's like Subnautica, but on Earth with a raft instead of underwater bases and whatnot, but the execution misses the mark in several places and bring it down to a level of frustration that I simply cannot recommend on it's own.If you're willing to mod the game, just be warned that the mod loader does some memory hooking/injection that your antivirus might flag as suspicious (I've heard BitDefender broke the ability for Raft to even launch as a result of the mod loader), it doesn't harm your system from what I can tell, but it does use methods that malware has been known to use.But yeah, to wrap this all up, I cannot recommend this game if you're simply planning on playing it vanilla, now if you play with your friends or with mods, it's a different story (still has issues but not as bad) but by yourself without mods, it's just not fun.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI still haven't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ through the first chapters of the story and I've already played 10 hours.The main problem after 10 hours is the shark mechanic. There should be a better way to keep players involved, maybe instead of ALWAYS having a shark there, have a variety of sea monsters and creatures that you get to battle? Wouldn't take too much work, just a few 3d models and you could have like 20 varieties of creatures, small shark, medium size shark, large shark, and epic shark, small squid, medium squid, large squid, and epic squid etc... as you progress, and have them come up randomly, but have it be like an exciting event.The raft also isn't breakable, the shark can take like a tiny chunk out of it, but that doesn't really make for much excitement. It'd be amazing if you built up this raft, there were sea creatures every 30 minutes or so that came and you had to stock up and battle them while they tear your stuff up.Right now, when you kill the shark another shark takes it's place like 2 minutes later, making it kind of pointless in even killing him, you'd be better off throwing some bait in the water instead.The game is very slow, and only slow because the resource gathering is so slow on purpose to add on play hours to make the $20 you pay try to be worth it.A big problem, you can't really sandbox the game in the way you can with a game like Ark. You can't mod it or tear it apart and tinker with it, set up your own custom scenarios etc...The good about it, it's like 2GB to download, it doesn't have god awful loading times, it's light and compact (compared to other games these days), it doesn't have any problems when connecting with friends, I got it working very quickly, it's a co-op game so it encourages co-operative play.The only reason I wouldn't recommend, is that you can get Ark: Survival Evolved and not only do what this game can do but also use the cheats to create scenarios, armies hordes of creatures and you've got the same raft gameplay pretty much but much more. When you're at sea in Ark, you've got a variety of sea creatures that can cause you trouble, although of course Ark has it's flaws, I usually have to set hotkey cheats for basic items as the resource gathering in that takes far too long also.I'm going to try to progress through the first chapter and the second chapter of the story and see if it changes my opinion around, but I don't also have all the time in the world to sink like 50+ hours into a game.",N/A

I mean 75% of the game is just collecting materials, standing on your raft crafting stuff, tools, food, fuel, then the 25% you get to actually explore. Not to mention there is very few islands in this game, once u  have explored a few that is it you have explored most of the game. The story is ehh.. Not much went into making this game and I can see why the price for this game is cheap.  I didnt find much fun in crafting the same tools over n over n over again, they set the durability on everything far to low, made this game to much of a grind.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Ocak 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiFirst few runs of this game are fun, but its early game is super super boring.It has a great soundtrack, the late-game where you are just building a massive self sustaining raft is super enjoyable, but the early game (ESPECIALLY if you are playing with a friend or 2) are super super super tedious.Not to mention completely losing runs to bugs is frustrating too (Like how the boars or whatever can do a 180 snap while charging up to 6 times from my experience, how touching a friend can cause them to get hit by the shark if the sharks under the raft, and many many more)And there are some game breaking bugs that despite 4+ content updates have STILL not been patched.If there more to do early game comes rather than just sitting around with a hook, and if some of these bugs are patched, ill likely change my review to positive, because it IS a good game, it just has a lot of issues that ruin it for me personally.",N/A

The fact that it's been in development for years and they still haven't done anything to fix the shark being a major nuisance is kind of sad.I liked this game in the past, but currently can't recommend it until glaring early game issues around the shark are solved.

Yayınlanma: 12 ŞubatTerrible Game. Frustrating.The only pro of this game is its concept not its execution. The story lacked integrity as well as the basic idea of fun. Overall the game was lacking a lot and if I could I would get a refund. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE BORING GAMES!!!,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 8 Aralık 2019Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiI really wanted to like this game, but I just couldn’t.  Plot twist: it wasn’t because I got bored!  After reading some negative reviews, I thought I would surely get bored and hate this game.  But I played it in co-op, and actually had a lot of fun!  The reason for the negative review though, is that the fun is completely ruined by babysitting survival bars.And yes, I understand that most (all?) survival games are based around managing survival bars: hunger, thirst, boredom, stress, cold, hot, etc.  So this concept isn’t new to me, and I love survival games.  The problem I had is that all of the bars ran out WAY too quickly, and it took WAY too much to fill them back up.  That means most of your time isn’t spent playing the game, it’s spent babysitting fake meters on a screen.If, for some reason, you’re still reading this review, you’re probably thinking that there are only two survival bars, hunger and thirst.  That’s true on the UI, but I also view the shark and seagulls as survival meters that you have to manage.  And they also happen way too often, and take way too much to stop them.  I include seagulls, as not even scarecrows adequately stop them.  So instead of the survival bars pushing the game forward in a meaningful way, or being entertaining to fill up, they just empty super quickly, and you spend REAL WORLD TIME trying to fill them.  And they aren’t difficult to fill up, so there’s no challenge.Let’s take fishing for example:  Uh oh, I’m hungry; I’ll fish for food!  Maybe fishing will be a fun mini game!  Nope.  Okay, that’s fine, I didn’t really expect that.  Well, at least once I catch a fish, I can cook it and go back to having fun!  Nope, a cooked fish hardly fills my hunger meter, so I’ll have to catch 10 of them.  (Insert Spongebob’s, “Two Hours Later…”)And the game plays out like that with the other meters.  Grow plants to eat instead of fish?  Expect to fill a water cup, find wood to start the purifier, purify cup of water, and water the plants two times before they grow. Then repeat these steps five times, as you have to eat 15 potatoes to fill your stomach.  Thirsty?  Fill a cup of water, find wood to start the purifier, and repeat this step 10 times, as your character needs that much water every day.  And let me ask this: WHY?  Why does it have to be this way?  Why not allow one cup of purified water fill your thirst bar entirely?  What gameplay element would be negatively affected by allowing the player to fill their bars easier?And yes, I know you can unlock and craft new tech to speed these up.  But that’s not gameplay; that’s building a game around fake meters.  The meters aren’t fun, they aren’t challenging, they are just fake bars on the screen that I need to micromanage instead of playing the game.  Overall, I felt like it didn’t respect my time as a player, so I refunded it.  Maybe in the future, if they fix this, I’ll repurchase.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 9 ŞubatI WANTED to like this game. It had a huge amount of potential but it is, sadly, very poorly put together.Early game, the learning curve isn't just steep - it is vertical - core concepts - like food gathering - are not intuitive. You might get a potato from a crate - but to gather the resources you need to cook it or for something like a fishing rod takes a lot of driftwood you also need to fend a shark with a spear, or expand to actually have enough space to cook a potato whilst also needing to figure out how to purify water, your first play through will end in death in 15 minutes until you figure that out.You'll then encounter the next problem, tools break after next to no use, so the resources you gather take resources to build the tool again to gather the same resources - it's an endless resource loop which is the least fun part of the experience overall with low resource generation (a tree gives you 3-4 planks of wood) and high resource cost (cooking a fish takes 3 planks of wood) - you CAN get better tools - but the top tier tools - those which will do most damage, last longest and would help you survive - come after you beat the last boss in the story, at which point, you're done with this game (and more on the 'story' later)BUT once you are past this initial hurdle, the strongest part's of the game come out - the raft building aspect is the most developed part of the game and clearly the main attraction - but it is a grind. But having finished a full playthrough building out and developing your raft is very satisfying.For once, a steam award makes sense - the game IS much better with a friend - I played this through with my partner and had a lot of fun working together on environmental challenges and managing the raft. That said, the syncing is sometimes a little bugged.Just floating around and exploring islands early on is quite fun - the initial islands and the first and second chapter islands are well designed and captivating. The total absence of human life, and subtle clues of some cataclysm, like a mountain hideout which has been sunken underwater by rising oceans, is strong. However, the early satisfaction is let down by the amount of repetition you get visiting the same island multiple times because it re-spawns ahead of you, with the exact same number of limited hostile animal types all of which are next to immortal with poor tools (you will sigh when you hit a bird attacking you with rocks 15 times with an arrow and it finally falls like some oversized flying pincushion)Sadly - if you want better tools/items for your raft you HAVE to engage with the story - for the first two chapter islands this is fine, the islands fit in with the gameplay and sense of wonder/drift you get from floating in an endless ocean just fine. Chapter three is a total departure, however. The game goes from survival/exploration to a hack and slash platformer. It doesn't fit, it doesn't work and is outright insulting given how it could have been handled otherwise.The last island, in particular had a lot of promise - perhaps it could have been somewhere you could settle down and build out - there's a large farming area which could have the raft building elements used on it post game so you make a full time anchorage you could come back to - but instead it's a frustratingly poorly put together puzzle piece not justifying the large scale - the big bad you spend the whole game 'chasing' is a narrative let down - nothing in the design of the last island makes sense from a stroytelling point of view. It feels padded out, and that's because it is. It lacks direction because I fear the developers lost their way and it is a shame that it ends in this unpolished way.And unpolished is the main point of it. There are bugs aplenty, Collision is a joke, hitboxes are a joke, your kill will clip out through a cliff or the floor meaning you can't gather it's resources. Your friend will spawn into your world underwater, under the raft, which, if it's a big one, will mean they drown. You'll spend an hour or two making your way through a major story island only for the lift to the last, highest room disappear while you are in it so that you fall to your death....The progression is so off - useful tools come around two islands late for them to be useful. You get a titanium hook - a plastic hook being your first tool used to gather resources - after the main story is over - by which point you're so bored of seeing the same island for the 10th time you'd rather alt f4 than hack at the same resource gathering node yet again. You also get titanium weapons - after a ludicrous final boss fight which would have been the only real reason to use those weapons. In a game with a clear plot point about ecological collapse you develop fuel oil to move your raft and power your systems long before you get a windmill which could do the same thing, almost like an apology.If you enjoy wandering an endless sea and building out a raft with a friend - the game is atmospheric enough to warrant playing it. As I said at the top - I wanted to like this game - but in the end, I doubt I'll ever pick it up again.Sadly, a mixed review - I hope the developers revisit this in the future - and improve the game - it deserves that effort.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Şubat""Raft"" is a survival game where players must build and maintain a raft while trying to survive on the open sea. It has received mixed reviews, with some players enjoying the experience of trying to survive against the elements, while others may not find it as appealing. Different players have different preferences and opinions about games, and what may be considered the worst game for one person may not be for another. It's important to keep in mind that opinions and preferences are subjective and personal.The game sucks",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Ağustos 2022Why the negative review?Quite simply, the game has very basic building blocks, very few in fact, so few that it's just a matter of inputting a 'lucky' random seed until you hit jackpot and are able to get traction. Until then, it's just retry after retry doing the same minigame not dissimilar to these claw machines you find in arcades.It's very basic for a game that's been so long in development, and suffers from many issues, the worst one being the story mode being almost a second thought, something added at the end. We could have had a great firewatch meets survival in an open world settings, instead we get a repetitive, unoriginal, uninspired 'survival sim' straight out of the great pit of survival sims.You have much better choices out there, and if you like a good story, definitely look elsewhere: this is not it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 10 Temmuz 2022Do NOT be fooled by ""final"" in Final Chapter,this game is still incomplete.[The Story]The story and the ""raft"" concept of the game do not relate to each other enough.The raft building progressing do not match the progression of the story almost at all,except for one or two items that you need to move around blocked / closed spaces.[The Raft]Guess what, you get additional recipes for tools and new resources AFTER the main story ends...As I said, the raft building progression and story progression do not match.[The Positives]So, despite an awful synergy between the story and the raft building / survival,this game is still fan to play, especially with friends.You can enjoy your raft journey, BUT it will be heavily limited by short and underwhelming story,unless you are a gamer who does not care about the story, and cares more about the survival / building aspect,then you will enjoy playing this game.*Although, ""survival"" aspect isn't developed to its full potential, either.",N/A

If you get overloaded with loot and pick up something else best not stray too far because if its something you really need and nip back to the raft to make room it will despawn almost instantly you move out of a very small range.Great game let down by the timesink mechanic which bores you into submission.

I say this having played on the least demanding mode for hunger and thirst -- other settings will make the problem even more severe.

"Yayınlanma: 22 Eylül 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiBeen playing awhile now with over 200 hours Started playing with a friend who eventually moved on Subnautica, also on Steam. We have two laptops; both are used for Subnautica and for World of Warcraft. Both handle the intensive graphics of these two games, very well.  So?I have had consistent issues with RAFT, but not every day and not all day. For example, the shark attacks the raft and I defend. at some point I am frozen, not the grpahics or shark - just me. Shark is allowed to finish the attack and move on. This happens on both laptops. Customer service response - your specs are at our minimum  requirements (this is a theme song).Once you learn how to farm islnds and stations, kill crap, build crap the only thing left to do is use your imagination and build up the raft; decorate, etc. Raft grew to 40x40 in size and when I hit an island or station, or a storm, I got major lag. Customer service - your specs are at the minimum or below for your graphics card/we have a known issue w/AMD cards and working it/your raft is too big. So forget customizing the raft, cut it back to 20x20. Some lag still exists but it did improve.Recently, I can play for an hour with zero issues. I mean building kilns, cooking seaweed, cooking fish, creating items for support like bows, axes, etc. Kill the shark, farm an island, farm under the water around islands and stations - almost error free. But, I equip the mallet and the lag kicks in. Wierd, right? Customer service: your system specs are below our minimum requirements. The fact I just played for an hour or sometimes a lot more - error free, somehow slipped by them.Finally, one customer service rep told me to request a refund - very good business practice, or not. I send videos to show what's going on, I explain things in detail, I let them know it was working perfectly for an hour and then bang LAG - and I get your system specs do not meet our minimum........what a poor excuse for poor development and poor customer service.With that said, and if you never need customer service the game can be fun and I have see players on Youtube who created beautiful rafts with walls, etc.  So it can be fun and exjoyable way to spend time. Just never need customer service.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 31 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiSurvival games have to maintain a balance between fun and survival elements.  And this is where Raft fails, the fun. The repetitive food, water, food, water, shark gameplay gets irritating very quickly.  There is little sense of accomplishment to the game because of it.  After you kill the shark, an identical shark appears moments later.  And when you get to the bigger islands, instead of a respite from the annoying shark, there is an annoying bird dropping rocks on you.  It's literally the same mechanism.  Everything, the same 3 hits and you die and lose everything you are carrying.The game doesn't challenge you, it annoys you.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 Temmuz 2022This game ruined my friendship with my best friend of 10 years! The game starts off strong, it’s very engaging and challenging, and every new recipe learned feels like a big step forward. Unfortunately, by the time you reach the 3rd island, you’ve spent 80% of the time just grinding, grinding, grinding. Every piece of item you have breaks incredibly fast, and has to be rebuilt, instead of just being able to repair them using fewer resources. The shark becomes less than a challenge, and can easily be killed by 1 person over and over without taking any damage, and the sense of progression is completely gone. Me and my friend, who have stuck together through thick and thin for 10 years, finally got to the fabled “bear island”. We were excited to finally be off the raft and explore a large landmass covered in trees and foliage. Unfortunately the pacing, level design and enemy encounters were so poorly made it made us literally vomit. The “puzzles” overall is a joke, and don’t get me started on the voice acting and “writing”. As stated before, me and my friend have been best friends for 10 years, laughed and cried together, shared milestones in our lives with one another, and this game broke our spirits so much we haven’t talked since we rage quit playing halfway through the 3rd island.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 Eylül 2022I REALLY HATE that you're game is designed it way that is either play multiplayer 100% of the time or get an experience that feels either too easy to the point of feeling like I'm being treated like a child or that it becomes a hostile experience that dying becomes a save killer. Where hours spent trying to get back to the point in a new save that I was in the prior one are wasn't cause all the items I need to try again can't be recovered. You designed a balanced game, then choose to make it unbalanced unless someone was willing to either invite another player, likely with a very different play style, or mod the thing into something actually use-able. And no being able to mod a game to make it play-able isn't an excuse not to fix your broken game. It just tells players that you don't care what they want. No matter how SIMPLE it may be. I really wanna enjoy what you've made. But just knowing that the devs choose to create such a headache makes me wanna go play a souls game instead. It'd be more zen to die again and again in that. Cause playing that felt less punishing than Raft. Cause at least that game felt like it was balanced like it was designed to be. I am so tired of playing a game I love so much of to hit a wall and fall into a pit I can't climb back out of.PLEASE PLEASE...

"Yayınlanma: 5 Eylül 2022I really want to like Raft, but there's a lot of things the game does that just frustrate and make no sense. The game works on weird logic and breaks its own rules often. Why does a bird take so many arrows to kill? Why are logs and large trees unable to be chopped down? Why is the bucket only for milk? The experience just ends out being a mess where you can often just feel like you fell into a trap for not playing exactly the way the game intends.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 23 Ağustos 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game manages to be boring and stressful at the same time! I love survival games/open world games, so I tried giving it a chance. (4 hours)Firstly, the upkeep (hunger, thirst, shark attacks and bird attacks) are repetitive to the point of giving me anxiety. You feel like you're constantly running around doing upkeep, and if you want to spend just a few minutes just trying to figure out what to do next (looking at research options on what to make and collect) then you get interrupted by the annoying bird/shark.We ended up in a situation where we ran out of stuff to research and craft unless we found new stuff, and finding an island takes a long time.  Unlike many similar games where you explore and run around you're spending a lot of time staring at the ocean. I suppose it could have been kind of cozy and fun if there was more to do on the raft and you weren't being constantly attacked. The creative building/cosmetic stuff didn't seem worth it.In conclusion, it seems like they wanted to create and idle/clicker resource management game mixed with Minecraft. Didn't work, AT ALL.  And they spaced out the games content making it feel very empty and pointless. They have NO BUSINESS selling this game for such a high price.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 8 Eylül 2022This game is just very meh.I like grindy games, but there needs to be a point to it; a sense of accomplishment. Here, the constant struggle to survive/keep your raft from being eaten etc. is way too annoying. There are clues to more content and different islands later as you progress and can focus less on survival, but by that time I lost interest in the game entirely because of the abovementioned grind. The visuals and music are decent but not good enough to compensate for the game's flaws. IDK what's supposed to be the fun part of the game - the irritating survival mechanics? The exploration of repetitive and similar islands? Building your raft? Revealing the bigger story? If I want a ""crafting/building"" game, there are better alternatives; same goes for the story and for survival. Very disappointing game especially considering the hype.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Eylül 2022Don't get me wrong, it's an alright game, however I do have some issues with it.The game is super repetitive, like to the point where it's really really boring. Yeah sure the game does throw some progression and new things to try and keep it fresh however you're still doing the same thing over and over again until you get a new thing and then you doing the same thing over and over again until you get a new thing, you get the point.The shark, the seagull are there to ""keep you on your toes"" but they're just extremely annoying.Well perhaps the game is not for me, however me and my friend just got bored really quickly and I don't understand how the game is this well received.

The story and characters were incredibly dull, the water was barren, the enemies were an infinite annoyance and added no semblance of real difficulty, the grind was tedious at best, and you unlock all of the interesting crafts so late into the game that there is zero reason to actually craft them. The grind was so boring that, in the end, we crafted next to none of the interesting ""QoL"" late-game items. I wanted to enjoy this game, since I love the survival co-op genre, but the use of enemies and progression ruins it for me.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 26 Aralık 2022Fun concept, but basically no controller integration. I understand it's not easy so I'm not knocking the game per se.

"Yayınlanma: 4 ŞubatAfter beating the ""story"" I feel I'm qualified to leave a review. I'm not going to get overly negative or say anything unfair about this game, as what I like about it, I really do like, but I would still rate this game as not recommended because and solely because of the ""story.""I didn't buy a puzzle platformer game. I wasn't looking for a puzzle platformer game. I bought Raft because it advertised itself as a survival game. For the first few story islands, I was okay with some of the hurdles and puzzles the game threw my way. They weren't particularly challenging and mostly involved simply finding the right items to progress. This all changed once reaching Tangaroa Island. I'll admit I'm not good at slide puzzles but at least that didn't take too long. Some of the puzzles, however, felt like less of a brain teaser and more of a trial and error time sink. On the rare occasion you have hints, they're not exactly clear, so often they don't help until after the fact.As for the ""Story"" itself, it's told entirely through the eyes of NPCs you never meet until everything's over. There's no investment or stakes at all really, especially since the game gives you a vague objective as a ""Forward Scout"" before proceeding on a bizarre tale that tries to tackle class struggles, environmental issues, power-hungry dictators, and more, but never does so in any engaging way. Where did the Forward Scouts come from? What's our actual role in any of this? Why does that Hyena bleed acid? None of the real questions I ever had are answered. By about halfway into the story islands, I stopped even listening to the audio recordings or reading notes because I just couldn't be bothered to care anymore.Resources and tools are treated in a fairly sloppy manner. I'm getting away from my big issues with the game and down into nit-picking, but there is just no good reason for good tools to break so frequently, or to need new glass and clay all the time for bowls, drinking glasses, and honey jars. The only reason I could imagine was to increase the need for these resources without regard for realism. I won't address the inaccuracy of the shark or any of the weird ""mutant"" species you encounter, because I understand games need threats to keep things interesting.I wouldn't be so upset about the story or its puzzles if not for the fact that in order to acquire the best tools and resources the game has to offer, you *have* to tackle the story. With the addition of the trading post, the story could have been made into an optional part of the game for those who had interest in it. Instead you basically *have* to experience the third-rate story and obscure pointless puzzles to reach a decent comfortable point in the game.",N/A

The concept is great stranded on a raft that you can increase in size as well as add usable structures to survive. Currently the game has to much of a micro management system for single player. For example as single player the thirst and food drain is to rapid. The food and water you consume does increase the stat bar but not by much. This i feel needs balanced out better. The Paddle and sail do not make navigating the raft fun. The paddle breaks to soon and the sail even with rotating it doesn't move the raft properly.  I look forward to seeing where this game goes from here.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 ŞubatThis game does NOT deserve all of the attention it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I have things to say about the game as a whole, and lots of tiny nitpicks that build up to make the game not so great.Firstly, on the technical side, this game makes my PC absolutely chug. I'm playing on medium settings and my Alienware Aurora R11 absolutely cries at the thought of this game launching. It also has some low quality texture issues.Secondly, this game has issues on a fundamental level. Personally, I love hard games with difficult enemies, but the shark is absolutely horrible. It is really obnoxious to have to repair the boat constantly, and the shark is really quiet for some reason. The seagulls eating plants don't have this issue since scarecrows exist and they are actually loud. One of the major issues with this game is the main loop: collecting materials. Sitting on a boat and micromanaging all of your responsibilities can be fun, but most of the time its boring. Similarly, collecting the underwater resources are literally never explained or shown in a subtle way, so I assumed for a long time that the only way to farm scrap or other metallic/stone resources was luck out of crates or on island chests. Another issue is the lack of a death penalty. You can put all of your items in a chest, die, and spawn back with more hunger/water with no item loss. Lastly, the movement in Raft is kinda wonky. Aerial movement feels out of wack and like it was made in a few hours. Some of the menus are placed weirdly on the screen to.Overall this is the worst game in my Steam library, which also holds ""gems"" like Trove, Creativerse, Craftopia, Tank rush, and 8BitMMO. I wouldn't even recommend this for a ♥♥♥♥-around with friends because the connection is bad.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Aralık 2022Multiplayer has so many bugs its unplayable for now, being a game I'd rather play with friends I wouldn't recommend it.The issues being:1.

Opening a chest made us stuck in the chest interface, for which we had to reload the whole world. (placing it somewhere else didn't help)3. When using the plastic hook, the items got stuck on it and it was unusable.4. There were random inputs to run forward.5. It took us ca. 1 hour to even get onto a server togetherAll those occured in under 2 hours of playtime and researching online didnt bring any kind of fix, which was frustrating to say the least. I cannot report about the single player experience tho, so take this with a grain of salt.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 13 Aralık 2022The way the game is currently, I really can't recommend dragging yourself through the slightly above average story.Most of my issues come with the artificial increasing of the playtime, applied through arbitrary and inconsistent rules and mechanics. For example:- Late game when farming for titanium, which is the only unique drop for the metal detector(outside of cosmetic items), there is not a 100% chance for actually finding titanium. In fact I had to search 3 separate islands to find a cache that dropped titanium. If you want you can spend hours fishing, again which is all based on luck, to gain reputation at trade posts(finding them on islands by chance), to gain titanium ore.- The shark will travel through walls and your entire raft to attack you, doing more damage at times then the rhino shark.- Having each item needing multiple titanium bars when, as i mentioned before, Titanium is quite hard to come by, is ridiculous. Why does an advanced collection net need titanium?-engines take way too many planks to work, and only having two engines and multiple tree plots wasn't even letting me break even. not to mention any wood i needed for crafting or expansion.- the shark is able to destroy hours of work by destroying a single piece of wood. I'd know as it destroyed one of my engines. With no planks(due to engine issues, see above) I had to resort to the sail once again to scrounge up the planks needed.I have many other gripes with this game, But I've done enough ranting. Watch a let's play or read the wiki to learn the story of the game. Don;t put yourself through this.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Ekim 2022Koitetaan kertoa lyhyesti jos se suinkin on mahdollista. Tuli yllättäen tarve pelata jotakin selviytymispeliä ja tässä oli ehdottomasti mielenkiintoinen idea. Koukuttava tämä myös on tavallaan, mutta hitaan edistymisen vuoksi tämän parissa pääsi vahingossa vierähtämään niin kauan, että oston peruuttaminen ei ollut enää mahdollista. Koukuttavuuden lisäksi hyviä puolia vaikuttaisi olevan melko monipuolinen valikoima rakennettavaa kalustoa.Sitten niitä negatiivisia asioita. Aloitin tämän neljä kertaa uudestaan kun asioita oppi ja tajusi, että mitä kannattaa tehdä missäkin järjestyksessä, että noutaja ei tule aivan alkumetreillä. Olen pelannut alusta alkaen normaalilla vaikeustasolla, mutta en osaa sanoa mikä noista olisi paras. En kuitenkaan aio käyttää tämän parissa loppuelämääni, joten muut vaihtoehdot jäänevät kokonaan testaamatta. Suurin ongelma on koko pelin järjetön hitaus. Toki jos teemaa mietitään niin eipä kovin realistista ole rakentaa mitään valtavaa valtamerialusta muutamassa yössä, mutta pelin viihdyttävyyden kannalta hitaus vie mehut. Resurssien hankkiminen on tehty myös naurettavan vaikeaksi. Esimerkki: Jos tarvitset hiekkaa johonkin rakentamiseen niin sitä ei löydy rannalta vaan meren pohjasta. Sieltäkin vain muutama erikseen merkitty keko joista saa +1. Yhden riutan lieppeiltä voi löytää 3-6 kpl. Sama homma monen muun materiaalin kanssa; kiveä ei myöskään saa louhittua eikä niitä loju rannoilla vaan kaikki noukitaan pääasiassa meren pohjasta. Sukeltaa ei voi koska meressä on valkohai jatkuvasti kimpussa... siis tarkoitan jatkuvasti; hyökkää paatin kimppuun kerran 5 minuutissa ja jos tiput veteen niin max 5 sekuntia ja fisu on kimpussa. Haita toki voi häiritä syötillä, joka pitää sen kiireisenä hieman reilun minuutin. Tässä ajassa pitää yrittää etsiä ja hakata irti materiaalit pohjamudista. Syötteihin menee kalaa ja narua. Kalaa saa virvelillä johon menee puuta ja narua. Ensimmäiset tavarat ovat suht helppoja tapauksia, koska perusmateriaalia; muovia, puuta ja palmunlehti (narua) tulee vastaan aika tasaseen tahtiin. Välineet eivät tosin kestä kovin pitkään eikä niitä voi korjata, joten uusien rakentamisessa menee taas materiaalia. Pelihahmolla on myös jatkuvasti nälkä että jano ja ruuista sekä juomista saa melko vähän täydennystä. Kulutus on myös sitä luokkaa, että olen tässä 7h pelikokemuksen perusteella todennut tämän olevan pääpainotteisesti syömiseen keskittyvä peli. Olen päässyt siihen pisteeseen, että sai sulattamon tehtyä ja pääsin tekemään rautaharkkoja. Tässä kohtaa avautui paljon uusia ja hyödyllisiä rakennettavia välineitä, joiden ajattelin muuttavan pelin suuntaa paremmaksi, mutta totuus olikin toinen ja tein päätöksen tulla antamaan peukun alaspäin. Rakennettavia tavaroita, työkaluja ja aseita on kuitenkin aika paljon eivätkä nämäkään lopulta kestä kovinkaan pitkään. Yhdestä rautamalmista saa yhden rautaharkon ja yhdestä rautaharkosta VAIN yhden pultin tai saranan. Yhden malmin sulattaminenkin kestää melko kauan, joten hyvin todennäköisesti mielenkiintoni ei tule kantamaan, että jatkuvasti rakentelisin työkaluja, jotka hajoavat parissa päivässä.Resurssipainajaisen lisäksi peli on myös melko buginen eikä maailmassa tunnu olevan juuri muita uhkia kuin tämä yksi hai. Myrskyjä pelissä ei ilmeisesti ole, joista olisi vaaraa alukselle... ja toisaalta hyvä niin koska pelin fysiikkamallinnus ei oikein tunnu handlaavan alusta jos se hieman isommassa aallokossa osuu esim. kiven tai korallin päälle. Lopputuloksena on pelottavaa nykimistä ja sätkimistä suuntaan jos toiseen, jolloin pelaajan on helppo pudota paatin kyydistä. Mielenkiintoa alkoi jo nyt lannistaa se ajatus, että onko pelin maailmassa oikeasti mitään sen suurempaa sisältöä. Tiedän, että tähän jonkinlainen tarinapuoli kätkeytyy, mutta tällä hetkellä näyttää siltä, että sinne asti ei meikäläisen resurssit tule riittämään.Loistavalla idealla on tämän pelin kohdalla lähdetty liikkeelle, mutta lopputulos on todella hidastempoinen, turhauttava ja buginen. Sen verran koukuttavuutta tuohon rakenteluun tästä kuitenkin löytyy, että saatan antaa tälle vielä uusia mahdollisuuksia ja tulen arvioimaan peliä uusiksi jos näyttää siltä, että nämä luettelemani miinukset jotenkin hyvittyvät jollakin, mitä en ole vielä nähnyt.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 19 Ağustos 2022This game is grindy i have to admit but you kinda get what you signed up for. the problem i have is with the save system say you want to save before running into a giant bear or the rhino shark. if you die the world back you just made, when you load into it it it will kill you anyways, and on normal this means you lose 2/3 of your stuff even if you save before the fight. this issue really needs to get fixxed because it punishes you to much. I have completed the game on easy, but wanted to try normal, and saving before a fight should put me back to before the fight not losing my items all over again.if any developer sees this please take my advice.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Ağustos 2022This game is aight. 4-5/10.I played this game with a friend. We had a lot of fun the first 1/3 of the game then it got progressively stale and uninspired.Positives:-Challenging in the beginning (we played on hard)-It is co op and the co op works well.-Surviving in the beginning is intense and fun.-There are a few quite interesting islands.-There is a good amount of items to unlock in the early and mid game.-You build your own ship!!!-Relatively cheap, probably worth its price. Maybe.Negatives:-Combat is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and exists just for the sake of being there. It is too clunky for me to say that it at least serves its purpose.-The end game is quite lacking. I was really hoping for solar panels to automise some machines, but you can never do that. It feels like the last 1/4th of the game is missing in terms of progression.-The game gets boring in the last 1/3rd. Surviving is now a chore, doing the same things over and over. The last late game machines and recipes help with that but they come too late.-There aren't enough unique islands. You will see every possible island variation too soon (around half way, excluding the story islands)-BIGGEST PROBLEM: The second half of the game is uninspired and rushed.-The puzzels are pretty bad and boring. Most of them repeat. Look around, find these items, go back.-The story islands are interesting visually, but are a bore in terms of gameplay.-There aren't enough interesting things/items to find.-There is a lack of late game progression/survival. The game becomes going from one story island to the next. You are barely incentivised to discover new regular islands. This could be fixed by adding new regular islands after you get to the 4-5th story island that contains materials for late game machines, like solar panels, a submarine, permanent diving gear, a modern weapon etc. Those regular island could contain the materials for these machines and gear.Conclusion: Fun and challenging the first half, unique (you got a raft!), interesting story islands visually; terrible combat, rushed and uninspired second half and lack of endgame.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 24 Temmuz 2022'Tis better to raft on s*it than s*it on raft. Extremely aggressive shark can go through islands.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Ağustos 2022Not recommended.  It pretends to be open world, but it's not really.  The shark is always there and just follows u the entire time. Even if you kill it another takes its place, very unrealistic. It attacks your raft periodically, your spears keep breaking etc... u try to get metal by diving or fall in the water at any time and old mate is there to attack you.  This shark has nothing better to do than follow and harassing you the entire time. Even sharks get bored sometimes!! not unlike myself after playing this game for an hour or two.In addition, there is a stream of debris that you have to follow, which takes you through the game. If you deviate from this you can't really progress, robbing the game of its sense of open world.  Also the game follows the raft not you, meaning if you hope on an island and your raft floats away - you have to restart as you can't build another as the game is tied to that one raft.  The game forces you down a path, whether you want to go there or not.  Not realistic, not open world, just crap.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 Ağustos 2022Peaceful? Like hell it was!It was going so well till the last chapter, and suddenly, it became an action, platform, fighting game with miserable, grey concrete locations, complicated obstacle courses, no joy, and constantly getting bitten, poisoned, bombed, and torn to pieces! And the story was nonsense.  I gave up at the last location.All in the so-called ""peaceful"" mode which the game assures me means I will have no enemies.It feels like the game was taken over by someone who wanted to turn it on it's head because they hate all these players who are ""too wimpy to fight!""So, chapter one and two in peaceful? Really nice.Chapter three?A complete disaster for me. Very annoyed.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022What a pile of crap. Stupidly hard on solo,. Food and water go down way too fast, the shark is annoying as hell, crafting everything at once when the shark is eating your boat and food and drink are eating you, you have no time, and everything needs rope...even a spear a damned sharpened stick needs 3 rope and water purifies one cup at a time and while you are making a spear, a purifier and anchor, rope rope and rope the shark is eating the boat, you are on the verge of death all the time and then the sun goes down and you cant sleep...haven't the time for that.In co-op the in game chat is just annoying, open the craft menu and the shark attacks you have to close it, choose spear and stab and the shark is gone ripping more boat away so...need wood and plastic to fix that when you had planned on making something else. Finally you have an anchor and can land on an island and you die of thirst and hunger because you need stones and you have one potato and the one cup of water is back on the boat and the game makes you walk slower now as you are dying.screw this damned game, what a piece of garbage",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 11 Temmuz 2022Overall, after an hundred of hours, I observed that ironically the game failed at both thing it was supposed to be, an exploration and building game.Basically, the exploration is terribly limited since you are surrounded with nothing but water filled with sharks, to keep you on your raft. Besides, water surrounding you 100% of the time is empty, so no incentive to go there.Raft failed miserably at exploiting what would have been it's BEST feature, large bodies of water.Then you have some islands, which are tiny (even the bigger ones) and have nothing to offer that you cant already make or find on your raft (with the exception of 3 critters with their products that only need to be acquired once and a trading post). Each island instances have the some ""hidden"" caches always spawning at same places everytime, so you can easily hunt for the caches (full of stuff you can already make on your raft) without having to risk actually exploring once you set foot on a known island type.For building aspects, the raft crafting as nice aesthetics, you just have to pick barrels and crates floating around to unlock them, no exploration needed! (*sigh*...)It as a good mix of aesthetic objects, props, options to color every object and blocks but not enough techs and tools to make it an actual technically fun building game like Astroneer, Satisfactory, Starbound, etc.Unlock a water purifier, then unlock a water purifier that can purify faster, then the modern one which can make it for bigger quantities. Makes a smelter, then make an advanced one that can smelt more, faster, you get the hang of it quite quickly: nothing changes really mechanic wise or motivates you to go up in the tech tree.Story starts great then goes awfully goofy very fast. A handful of characters are met once or never, with a couple paragraphs of monologue, to unlock them as playable characters that you never see because it's 1st person anyway, giving poor support to the storyline and none on the interaction department.I felt alone the whole time, even with online buddies in game. Bruce is your only companion, and hell he tries to kill you the whole game.I think looking at that much water for so long got me depressed, but this game WILL give you the blues.3/10",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 8 Temmuz 2022The game is awesome to play with friends but its hard to tell each other apart in game, even with the changing of the colour of the characters clothing is doesn't help much but would be better if we could customize our own characters instead of having 2 options at the start and then having to grind the game to unlock other characters that we will never use.If this customize character feature is in the works let me know, if not then hope it gets added in the future updates.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022New chapter is just bad. Garbage enemy AI/animations and also lots of bugs. Saved my world 5 mins before a power surge and when I got into the game I couldn't load the save because it said error. Loaded another backup and I had a new character and 0 items.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Nisan 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game has a great aesthetic that is ruined by whatever sadist balanced the gameplay.The juggle of food+water+shark very quickly becomes pure tedium. It's not difficult, it's just busy work; You can set your watch to the shark attacks they're just constant.You lose all your inventory when you die unless a teammate revives you. What kind of crap is that? Quality single player experience, there.The game auto saves when you die, only 1 save, you can not have a backup save game because we wouldn't want you to enjoy your experience, no you're in our torture machine and you will take it.Your tools are not repairable, you just have to continually rebuild them, and they don't last long. And they're expensive if you want ones that aren't trash.Growing does not yield a net positive in seeds (at least for palm trees), which is like, not how growing things works.. in general...Let's see here.. what else..The weather is purely visual; Even though the entire deck of the raft can be underwater it doesn't matter your fires keep going and your boxes are fine, storms are nothing but a slight annoyance.There is no reason to actually build any more of a raft than just a platform to put down a few crafting items, i.e. there's no reason to build a roof over your head or any kind of actual shelter.The game will stick you with busy work collecting random sea junk for hours before you can even BEGIN the story. Basically just be prepared to just be building a raft to survive on for hours before you have any clue of any direction in the game.There's no real rewards; Rare loot involves things like a shoe you can place on your raft, and a light source that doesn't produce light.In the end I just wanted a nice casual Raft experience but this is a pure torture simulator.I'm a regular Rust player. I know torture. This is torture.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game has an ok graphics style and mechanics are kind of ok, but the game itself lacks any excitement or feeling of danger. The sharks that eat pieces of your raft are really easy to scare away and even if you don't fight them they will just bite one piece that is cheap and easy to replace. Islands are inconsistent and you can only cut some specific trees which are also very scarce even in a forest parts of the islands (Sometimes there are none)..Overall very boring game, but if you are one for very simple and repetitive gameplay loops, or maybe you wan't to introduce your kid to survival games this could be a good choice. For adults and more experienced gamers, this is a big disappointment.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiOh lawdy, Raft is tedious as hell.Bought it for co-op and would've refunded it within the hour if not for playing with friends. Reckon I might go back to Ark for a relaxing break from this utter chore of a game.(update: Single player is monotonous but tolerable on Easy. The difficulty and jankiness of multiplayer combat is entirely due to lag - the combat is laughably easy when playing locally. The shark and screecher are mindless annoyances that exist only to waste your time and provide easy biofuel and food. The story/campaign is dumb and unengaging.)",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 27 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiFirst, our experience was good. The idea is very original. The graphics? Awesome cartoonish. But trust me it won't be lasted that long. I played with 1 my friend.To be honest, I couldn't recommend this game at this state. 2 years has passed and the game's state is developing very slow. Just by looking at the Update Post. Right now, 2 years from being released, this game only got 11 updates in 2 years. My game time only at 40 hours and I already reached end game with all items been crafted. Just 40 hours and I'm being generous since I include my afk time. Really, this game doesn't worth at full price and the devs just so freaking lazy.The bugs? Please don't let me tell you that if you go on multiplayer, you WILL always experienced weird bugs about boxes being opened and you can't close. Then you literally stuck in inventory menu which is annoying af. And multiplayer experience was quite awful overall due to some network issues and lag (my internet connection is very good here).

"Yayınlanma: 12 Kasım 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI enjoyed this game generally but I can't recommend it yet because of the lack of content.I started playing this game in late June 2018 and had a blast soloing, the artstyle is easy on the eye and the music is so relaxing. Then after around 20 hours I realized that there's nothing else to do in the game anymore (other than making your raft bigger of course). Then I stopped playing the game and started hoping for more contents. Recently I went back to the game again and surprisingly I didn't really find new recipes, everything looked more or less the same as one and a half year ago.Don't get me wrong, the game still runs well, looks beautiful and has some great soundtracks, but I just find nothing to do other than building my raft. Maybe I'm missing something? If so please point it out. Or maybe my perspective is different from the devs and this game is intended to be a more relaxing experience where you just go with the waves and admire the journey with a zen state of mind?",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 Aralık 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiAs of now very grindy, no story (at least at the earlier stages of the game) and not very helpful for noobs.

"Yayınlanma: 20 Eylül 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesicould be fun with a friend, but overall, thumbs downWhy?- there are games that do it better. Subnautica, Ark, forest, conan exiles... pick a thing.- the premise isn't very well thought out. From the whiteboard message, to literally mountains of junk in the sea helping shipwrecked people.- the game mechanics aren't well thought out. Making them kinda irritating. From land that exists, but being unbuildable. To plastic bottles in the ocean being converted to ""plastic"" which is then used to make plastic bottles? To the shark and seagulls being a constant annoyance more than anything (even if you kill them, at great cost of materials, they just come back almost instantly). The bow and arrow feel more akin to throwing an empty can at something, from the arc to the fact that it seems to do zero damage to a seagull via headshot from 1m away. To the fact that as a ""collecting"" game, the only way to expand your inventory comes POST endgame, after you've done everything, and there's literally nothing else to do.- The replay value feels like it's already negative, since as soon as you find a few islands, they start repeating..- on top of that it's buggy",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 MartOne of the biggest issues with the game is the lack of core mechanics. While the game has some basic survival elements like hunger and thirst, there is not much depth beyond that. The crafting system, which is a key part of any survival game, is also quite limited. There are only a handful of items that can be crafted, and the materials required to craft them are often difficult to come by.Another issue with the game is the lack of variety. While the ocean is vast, it quickly becomes repetitive as the player is constantly battling against the same few types of creatures and collecting the same resources over and over again.Overall, while the concept of Raft is intriguing, the lack of depth and variety make it difficult to fully recommend. With some polishing and improvements to core mechanics, it could be a great game, but as it stands, it falls short. As Anthony Fantano would say, ""Did you love it? Did you hate it? Well, I'm gonna have to give this one a solid 5 out of 10.""",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Temmuz 2022The Negative:1. The game is poorly balanced in multiplayer, resources are not scalable to the number of players:- the resource spawn (floating debris and barrel) is fixed, players cannot go to different direction to gather resources because they are fixed to the home base (the raft)- it's more difficult to feed/water 4 players since you need 4x the food and water and since the resources spawn at a fixed rate, some will go hungry/thirsty in the early game until you gather enough resources to build multiple water purifier/grill- it's easier to defeat enemies in multiplayer: 1 player can be the target and just try to avoid the attack and the others will attack the enemy from other direction.- some puzzles are way easier in multiplayer2. Some connectivity issue: desync, lags, sometimes the hook does not update in real time, making it difficult to gauge when to throw it.3. Endless blue ocean with little to no horizon in sight, can be disorientating to some players.The Positive: good building system, even with basic geometric shapes, one can build creative raft/barge/ship, just wish there's a bigger sail so I can make a proper sailboat",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Eylül 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft starts out with a little bit of Minecraft Skyblock feel to it, but instead of diving deep into a crafting tree, it instead goes for a somewhat grindy Sims / Survival genre loop, where you claw your way towards higher efficiency tech and a more a complete base (raft).Those bits were fun.A little further in and it introduces a storyline, with chapters, flavor text, and ... not very interesting exploration-based gameplay. Wander around this island gathering all of these widgets, then go to that island and wander around finding all it those widgets.I dig a good exploration game -- but Raft is not a good exploration game. Not very interesting environments, lots (and lots!) of repeated models, boring lighting, no sense of wonder, no real tension either. Just very blah.In their attempt to flesh out the game and tell a story, they've lost sight of the fun. The storyline pieces don't have enough novelty to carry their playtime, and seem designed more to stretch limited content then to delight. They wear thin, quick.I didn't finish this one.

"Yayınlanma: 28 Kasım 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is fun for the first few hours, but at some point you have built all important things and there really isn't much else to do. It gets a bit tedious to dive and get more stuff, especially because of the shark being relentless. The time it stays away after killing it was raised, but you will be far from your raft when it comes back and the only choice you have is to either kill it again, or die.The new bigger islands are ok, but after having visited 1 or 2, it doesn't add anything. I also found it strange that i got hurt while diving around the island. Until i found the birds are flying through the water like it's air and dropping rocks on me.You also cannot hurt the birds with your spear when they pick up a rock.Then seeing that all they are talking about adding is more plants and animals, this doesn't add to the game imho, so after the first few hours where you are just waiting to get the resources you need, there isn't any content to enjoy. To me it's a bit of a disappointment, writing this a few months after having stopped playing hoping for interesting content to be added.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 23 Haziran 2022TLDR : very slow paced survival game with massive downtimes between ''good'' partsfirst of all,  Love Survival games , i grew up with them but this one is ..... DifferentIt is a very chill game where you survive on water and expand your boat house base thing, and you need to have a lot of free time to enjoy it enough. it somehow feels like a mobile game but in first person and on PC with extra stepsIt has no random events going around you to keep you hooked During those looong minutes on the water with your boat, no weather that messes you up , the waves do get big somtimes but it dosent damage your boat or fill it up to keep you busy to keep your base floating. No big monster attacking you out of no where. the only thing happening around you is the same shark following you 24/7 monching off parts of your boats and u have to chase him away with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spear that takes 3 hits , so if you are late a few seconds he takes a chunk off your base no matter what.outside of that , you just grab random crumbles of stuff floating on the water around you with a hook to craft some tools and decorations until you land on a minor island that might have 3 fruits and a tree. but from time to time you will find a little bigger island with 3 mobs on it , bird, boar wich are trying to kill you and a chill goat. there might be 1 chest on there that gives you metal parts and hinges. wich you will already have 15 of if u hooked the said crumbles on the water.that was my experience for the 2 hours ive played it and if you are like me and a game dosent have a great start to make you hooked and dont have that much free time like i said earlier , i would suggest to look for another game with more survival mechanics than waiting around on your boat.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 Mart 2020Ürün ücretsiz alındıÜrünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesi!Review written in early access!What a fun concept! You and some(optional, yet highly recommended)friends are stuck on a raft with endless ocean around you, forced to survive by collecting materials drifting by to upgrade your raft with features that make life easier, and unlock new possibilities. . .Unfortunately, the fun wears off real quick, and dullness, monotony, and tedium takes its place. Playing just over 2 hours, I am now unable to return this game and it haunts me every time I see it in my Steam library--20 dollars flushed down the toilet into the endless figurative sea.(Since my review, I have been able to return the game).Allow me to give you some points of criticism that I wish I had known before I bought it. I even went out of my way to research the wiki just to point out some cold, hard facts, so please read this if you are seriously considering trying this game.Complaints:Keep in mind that my friend and I only played this game for a little over two hours. That means we didn't experience the full game, nor the more advanced items that might have made things a little easier; however, after two hours we honestly could not bear playing any more of this nightmarish hell.1. The Core Gameplay Mechanic is BoringIn order to craft, research, and expand your raft, you need to get materials. You can gather materials four ways:Finding chests on abandoned rafts/islands.Using collection nets to afk farm materials.Pressing E on materials that pass close enough to your raft to pick them up.Using a hook tofishthe item out of the water.The first way is fairly uncommon; during our play-through we only encountered three of these rafts with chests on them. Pressing E on things that pass just close enough means that you'll miss a lot of a materials as most of the time the items are out of reach, and using a sail to control the raft would be way too much micromanaging. Finally, collection nets are locked behind research and subsequently the research table, and thus won't be available until later in the game--they also require you to expand your raft to maximize yield and are vulnerable to shark attacks. That means a majority of the materials that you gather are going to be collected the fourth way: using the hook. Not to worry, you start the game with a hook.To use the hook, you use LMB to cast it, and LMB to slowly reel it in, hooking any materials that touches its tiny hitbox. How exciting! I will admit, this proved to be a somewhat relaxing and rewarding mini-game for a while, but my friend and I both grew tired of it and said, ""♥♥♥♥ this"". To havethisbe the core gameplay the rest of your survival game depends on is an interesting choice to say the least, and the mechanic grew dull very quickly.2. Materials Costs Are Too High/RareAn integral part of this game is crafting. The game is an endless cycle of gathering materials -> using materials to research things -> gathering more materials -> using materials to craft said-researched thing.This is fairly common in survival games, but Raft takes it a bit too far when considering the time necessary to gather these materials. The only raw materials you'll see floating around are planks, palm leaves, and plastic. While these things can be crafted into most of the beginning items, you'll soon need lots of metal materials such as scrap, metal ore, hinges, nails, and bolts to craft the late-game items. These materials are quite uncommon and can only be found in barrels/chests or crafted from scrap or metal ore.The frequency in which you find these items dictate the flow of your game, and can take tens of minutes before you see your next source of these materials (abandoned rafts, huts, and islands). Scrap is at least obtainable from the more common barrels, but the rarity of the other materials make this a game less about survival and more about waiting. The amount you need to craft all the higher tier items really makes me wonder if they made them so rare just to fill up the play time. Add the fact that your tools break and need to be re-crafted, the limited inventory and storage space, and the fact that you need rare materials just to research the thing that you want to build, and this game drops from dull to monotonous.3. Staying Alive is a Lot of Busy WorkMaybe I was just bad at the game, but keeping your food and water up was a real hassle. I played with one other friend, and someone had to constantly manage the food. You can either fish or farm for food. Farming requires you to build a farm plot and allows you to plant root vegetables or seeds obtained from barrels or islands. I've only had experience farming potatoes and beets so far. The small plot allows you to plant three separate plants, and requires clean water for them to grow. Each planted vegetable will yield two upon harvesting, and requires five minutes to grow. That means, in order to have enough potatoes to sustain your farm, upon fully filling up your plot with three potatoes, harvesting six, and replanting three, you will have earned a net gain of three potatoes.Now,Potatoes require clean water and 5 minutes to grow.Purifying water with a simple purifier takes 0.5 minutes.Total time to plant, water, and harvest a plot of potatoes is: [0.5 minutes (purifying) + 5 minutes (growing)] * 60 seconds/min = 330 seconds.Hunger depletes at a rate of 0.09/sec on normal difficulty.330 secs * 0.09 hunger/sec=29.7 Hunger depleted each while our potatoes grew.Arawpotato replenishes 10 hunger, while acookedpotato replenishes 15.Do you see the problem here? In the time it took to grow a full plot of potatoes, we lost more total hunger than we could replenish sharing three potatoes. That's not even accounting for the time required to COOK the potatoes, which by the way, along with purifying the water, require planks to be used as fuel. Again, we didn't get to the point where we would have a larger plot or an advanced purifier or grill, but even with two plots, we felt like we were constantly hungry, and someone needed to always take care of the food. Furthermore, seagulls come and destroy your crops if you don't shoo them away, so constant attention is needed. All this busy work made this game go from monotonous to tedious.4. There is Not Enough Content to Warrant Its PriceI suppose most survival games suffer from this, but Raft fails to deliver a fulfilling end game. Perhaps it's because the game forces you to become self-sustaining so quick, which tends to be the end goal of other survival games, but this rings especially true when you consider the hefty 20 dollar price tag. The end of the game so farinvolves you using a receiver to locate a radio tower which hints at a place called Utopia. No one has found Utopia yet, and its highly unlikely that it actually exists in the game yet.That's it. That's the goal of the game. I suppose you could try decking out your raft, but to me that is extremely underwhelming. I can see what they're trying to do--shoehorn in some semblance of a story/lore to the game, but it's just so unrewarding. Knowing that that's the ending of the game now, the game went from tedious to pointless. There is no point to playing this game, other than a fleeting sense of progress and creating some of your own fun with friends.Ultimately, this game is a great example of why you shouldn't buy early access games. Although the concept is good, there simply isn't enough in this game to keep you playing. Unfortunately, as if it's some sick joke, the developers crammed just enough in there to keep you occupied for two hours to the point where you realize the game sucks and can no longer return it.TL;DR: it's not fun, but if you still want to try it, keep an eye on your play time.",N/A

Some bugs have been fixed long ago however, these are the bugs SINCE it was fully released:1, hit-boxes not existing for players who join a world or being so small you have to be humping the mob to hit it.2, game crashing/insta dying if you play a new playable character on story islands.3, the new fridge being an over-sized chest (you get 1 extra line of storage than a chest which is 3 times smaller than the fridge).4, the new fridge deleting your items if you don't remove them first when removing the fridge.5, trading posts on islands with absolutely no hint or tip as to how you get the items within the trading post.6, buried items being in the air/inside the island (most of the times being completely unreachable).7, butler-bots having a special hit radius, you can move away from them but if you are anywhere near them you are getting hit regardless of how far you run away.8, Bruce biting you whilst you are on the raft9, animals gaining the ability to move through walls, fly and levitate off the raft even if you have them walled in on a higher level than ground level of your raft.10, the material upgrade of you hammer being selective of which items it'll remove from the wall or floor.11, buffs of smoothies not activating12, bosses not showing up OR! (even worse) multiple bosses.13, enemies being able to ""lock"" you within other items (hyenas dragging you into the movable crates)14, placing a new stationary anchor will stop your raft from moving at all, removing it doesn't matter. You have to reload.15, when moving items around on your hotbar you'll have a drink of water - not from a misclick. It just happens sometimes.16, islands seemingly reloading(?) whilst you are right infront of it.17, animals disappearing. no reason. they just vanished.18, host being unable to see other players wearing gear.Those are the bugs that I have found that I can remember SINCE final chapter launch within a new world.Some other ridiculous changes from early access to release are slower running in general. to get the original running speed from early access you must drink a special smoothie which you can't get unless you unlock it within the trading post which you have to fish items for and cooking pot only gives you 1 meal instead of getting 2-4 on ""better"" meals (shark dinner for example gave you 4, but now you only get 1)This update ""final chapter"" took nearly 2 years, it was originally called ""chapter 3"" implying more storyline and the fact that it took so long there shouldn't be this many bugs in the game. I haven't even touched on the janky jumping mechanics and seemingly lack of QA on this update. If you want to lose your patience, time and money, sure - buy this game and waste your time with it. However, if you feel like you should support an indie gaming company don't support this one. There are many that actually care about what you, the customer, want - and from playing this game since early 2019/late 2018 I can only assume the devs wanted to be done with this game with the amount of bugs that would have and should have been removed in testing.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 19 Kasım 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiI found this whole thing pretty tedious. The resource collection mechanic is attention intensive and takes a long time to get good at. Stopping it long enough get some decent crafting in doesn't seem like an option, even at the easy setting. There is no real tutorial so I'm not sure what I should be building first or what will give me the time to build more complex items. I just end up dying of thirst or starvation with a slightly bigger raft.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiI’ve played at least 10 hours in a single world and throughout this experiences I think I’m allow to do a review now. I would put mix if there is a mix button for recommendation.Little background of this game:This game kind of reminds me of Skyblock (don’t exactly remember the name, If I’m wrong then sorry about that) in one of the Minecraft modded map. You start from a tiny little block (raft in this game) and you slowly expend it via resources around you. Which kind of fun and challenging from the get go.Reason of not wanted to recommend this game:Once you reach to a self sustain for resource level, this game would get bored easily. No idea what to do anything just surfing around the world collecting more resource and so on so forth.Would definitely drop by and play this game again, see how it goes and re-write this review, once with more features adding in.

"Yayınlanma: 29 Kasım 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiBluf:  Requires mods to be playable.  Un-modded Raft is 3/10.   With mods, Raft can be fine, but why bother?  Other games do a similar survival bit, but better on all fronts, except the ""lost on the water"" gimmick.  QoL feels rare in Raft.Overview:With that, Let's be clear:  Raft is designed to WASTE YOUR TIME, and pretend that this is gameplay depth.99% of what you'll do early is resource gather, so you can pass the break-point of replacing used (read as ""wasted"") resources that are lost to game loop dumps, specifically: tool degradation and the shark.  Most default tools have 20-40 uses, and you'll need at least 3 uses of the hook to replace the hook.  The shark will bite on the raft, and either use spear ""uses"" or remove a part of the raft.  All while you are starving, and thirsty.  This ""race against resources"" is the primary game loop.  And if that's your cup of tea, you will probably love Raft.This is insulting, as grind due to ""resource spend"" isn't gameplay... it's a gameplay slowdown mechanic, masquerading as depth.  It challenges you to overcome this first hurdle of ""survival"" by constantly draining these resources on unbelievable loss, and the sharp knife edge of failure.Outside of this resource gather loop, there's very little to do, which is why this is totally unforgivable.Game parts:The music is nice, but forgettable.  It never feels overbearing or ""wrong,"" as long as you lower volume to at least 50%The graphics are fairly simple, but crisp, and usable.  They mostly don't interfere with gameplay, but there are points where they can surprise you, such as sunrise or sunset on the open water.  Being able to see collectibles at night underwater is a nice QoL perk, but it's really the only one.The building system is solid, with a nice snap-to, and rather forgiving on station placement, and removal. However, inventory control commands are without the standard QoL systems that are normal and expected fare for ARK, Rust, and other survival games.  Special awful mention:  ""Half-stack"" is hard bound to middle mouse button, and cannot be moved through the normal Settings UI.Combat against aggressive animals is rudimentary, and executed poorly, esp the bow.  Most wildlife feels like an afterthought, especially the Screecher, which feels wildly out of place.Moving the raft feels odd.  In the early game, you really can't turn or rotate your Raft, and are at the oceans' flow mercy.  Once you have a Sail, movement is a little better.  Story (resource) gating the Steering Wheel seems an odd choice.Final thoughts:Modded raft -can- be fun, look up ""Raft Mod Loader.""  However, I recommend giving this one a pass.  Ignore this, and go try ARK, Rust, Subnautica, or Grounded... heck even Valheim is better...  Yes, none have the ""on the water"" gimmick, but that's really the only good point, and unique play, Raft has going for it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 18 Ocak 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe underlying ideas of this game (island hopping on a raft) have potential. I'm not sure this game can accomplish that, even once it has left early access.Some things I can tie to polish & time; lack of any tutorialising, stilted & awkward combat, bugs (enemies kept clipping through terrain for one), repetitive environments (); all that can be improved with time, and will likely be by the end of early access.Execution however is poor, as this game lacks the flexibility of OWSC games like minecraft; or the simple, solid systems & objectives of a game like subnautica.There is very little to do beyond expand your raft, then track down radio signals. Minute-to-minute gameplay is hampered by fast hunger/dehydration, a constantly aggressive enemy (♥♥♥♥ the sharks) and a fragile raft THAT CAN BE LOST (effectively a game over though the game doesnt treat it as such), and enemies I only managed to kill by taking advantage of bugs. Maybe my playing solo ""isnt the intended experience"", but what little fun I had was despite the game and not because of it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Haziran 2021So far so bad.I'll just say, that ""Raft"" is not my cup of tea. And there are two reasons for that: 1) not satisfying / boring gameplay in general; 2) bad game design decisions.There are numerous games with sandbox survival and crafting elements. They are similar in some aspects, but might be unique in a few. Those unique aspects let you distinguish your playing experience in those games and find the ""fun"" element for yourself.""Raft"" doesn't give you a ""fun"", unique element. The only ""unique"" (not really) thing is the story and a player position - the waterflood-like apocalypse. And that's all. Gather resources, build a mobile base, find story pieces.So this game could be just OK, I guess (especially while playing with friends)... However, there are several things, that slowly ruin your wish to continue playing.I like survival elements. It was enjoyable to hunt bears, for instance. But...I. The shark. The real game breaker.No, I'm not talking about a survival element as the whole. Not even about slashing or shooting elements.I'm talking explicitly about the ""shark element"". No... the ""DAMN SHARK"" element! Let's see...Usually sharks are not man-eaters. A shark attacks a human, if that shark is really hungry (no juicy fish nearby) or a human prey is BLEEDING (or maybe simulates a sort of ""fish activity"" somehow...).And what do we have here? There is enough fish in the ocean and a human stays still in water with full health, not even a scratch on a body. However The Shark (tm) attacks a human anyway.If a shark should attack a human, it can do it not only alone, but also with its friends / relatives.So where are other sharks?Sharks eat fish. Not the wood. And definitely NOT THE ENGINE, DAMN IT!!!Dear developer, please read a few articles about sharks. You will find there many intriguing facts.But here in ""Raft"" we have The Shark (tm) - the single being, a super boss, which recreates itself from a scratch some time later after you kill it. It's always coming back for you. And it even doesn't react on your attacks - it bites you, even if you would launch a rocket point blank at it's face.Maybe you should create a separate game instead... The monstrous cyber-mutant sharkzilla named Bruce-the-Allmighty is terrorizing the ocean! Just step into the water for a single time, and IT WILL HUNT YOU DOWN! You may kill it. But IT'LL BE BACK! It will rise from the dead and chase you wherever you are. So reload your trusty minigun and get ready to lose all rounds, while trying to defeat IT.(Have you seen a short movie ""The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient Weapon""? Looks familiar, right?)Unfortunately there is no minigun in the ""Raft"".II. The seagull. The lesser irritating element.Seagulls attack your crops. This is OK.Seagulls attack your scarecrows... No, this is NOT OK.So we are back with a brand new game! One time ago a scarecrow fell down onto a mother seagull and killed her. Her son vowed to eliminate all scarecrows in the world. So recharge your trusty plasma rifle and get ready to fight the real terror! The nameless seagull ninja is AFTER YOUR SCARECROWS!Again, unfortunately there is no plasma rifle in the ""Raft"".III. Break your ""shift"" key.There is no ""always run"" function. Yep. Hold the ""run"" key for the eternity or move like a tortoise.----Summary: boring gameplay, irritating survival mechanics.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 12 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThere is nothing bad to say about Raft, it's a decent game that is maybe sometimes a little too simple, but other than that the game is great, and it only gets a negative review because of how devs are releasing the game. Not sure what game coming out of early access is incomplete, but I doubt many of them are. I wait to buy games because A. I'm not paying to play test your game for you and B. to play a completed experience.Unknown to me and my partner and despite being out of early access, Raft is an incomplete game. The devs intend to release ""Chapters"" which is just the incomplete game being slowly completed. Def did not expect to invest a bunch of time into something only to realise the game just abruptly ends. In my mind this is underhanded and just abusing the premise of early access and what we have all grown to expect from that.I've played and paid for enough incomplete content that I simply don't want it anymore, and feel pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hoodwinked when I can't even rely on the concept of peoples games coming out of early access to even define if the game is actually complete or not. Apparently it's just some arbitrary measure now devs use to decide when people should buy their game or not, whether it's completed or not.It would be one thing to invest an hour or so but we invested 32 hours only to end up with a game we can't finish, nor can even return. Just atrocious business ethic.",N/A

The survival part is just food and water without having to worry about sunburn despite being in the middle of the ocean. You can eat raw meat with no problems. Somehow a bird dropping a rock with no noise until it has dropped it does more damage than a shark biting you. And god forbid you have even the slughtest amount of latency.

"Yayınlanma: 31 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiFigured I would update the review.  There's still some poor choices by the devs in balancing that make the main gameplay loop frustrating and arbitrarily non-sensical.  My main gripes are centered around crops in the game.  Only the Beet and Potato are sensible.  Most of the rest of them are worthless outside of decorations.  You'll plant it, see several fruit on the tree, cut the tree down and if you're lucky get one or two fruits and rarely a seed to replant.  Watermelon and pineapple will always yield a fruit, but again, rarely a seed for re-planting.  Animals are also completely useless as they vanish when you re-load your game.  An old bug I guess the devs don't want to fix because as I said in my previous review, the devs enjoy dictating your gameplay in what would be an otherwise great sandbox.  They want you stopping at islands even though there's only a handful of different ones and they get boring fast.  letting your livestock poof and your food be unsustainable forces you to stop at islands more frequently and that seems to be the goal.  This is in spite of other poor design decisions.  They want you to stop at islands so of course you eat the clay bowls you prepare food in.  Maybe it combats dysentery to plug you up.  You also pour glass jars into your biofuel generator, but get free plastic coffee cans in return that you stuff into your gas tanks to be burnt along with the fuel.  For a game that makes many sane survival decisions... it makes more insane ones.  The tools still don't last for crap.  Not that the resources to make them are scarce, it's just another repetitive labor you have to do all too often.  Flippers are worthless.  You don;t need them if you're willing to dive up and down an extra time or two and they don't last.  Same with the scuba inspired bottle tanks, which have no legitimate reason to be wearing down at all.  All of this is fixable with mods for the most part, however I will still maintain a negative review because as I see it... this is a wonderful world and concept wasted on developers who have no clue how to make a good game great.   Hopefully someone with skill will create a competing version of this game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiCan´t really recommend the game to anyone looking for a long-term motivating game.Especially in the beginning the game is very grindy and the hunger/thirst mechanics are more annoying than fun. On Normal difficulty the shark becomes irrelevant for raft-construction as soon as you discover counter-measures and when diving you can easily kill him.Actual content in the game is virtually non- existant, the ""story"" is 4-5 locations which are based on ""run to A, get X, go back to A to access B"". There are some nice little stories to the locations, but they can´t help counteract the vast empytness of the game in terms of mechanics, mob variety, storyline, progression, exploration, or anything that would give the player a sense of accomplishment when reaching milestones or even completing the ""story"".When you are looking for a shallow game for an easy and non-stimulating experience, then this game might be for you though.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Ekim 2022Designing and building a Raft is incredibly fun once you unlock a few blueprints. Trying to design it in a way that is both efficient and useful was a good challenge.  Exploring the major story islands was a nice mix to the monotony of sailing. Collecting resources, exploring smaller islands, and repeatedly waiting 15 minutes for your raft to travel a few kilometers is not great. I often felt like I was doing chores rather than playing a game.  Raft does not strike the right balance between the survival mechanic and the monotony of repetitive tasks.

"Yayınlanma: 6 Ağustos 2022Interesting premise that feels severely undercooked and unfinished at many parts.There's virtually no danger of starvation or any of the predators in this game, and if you follow the main story along you'll be preoccupied with fetching items and solving menial puzzles that make you run around way too much while you refill your needs every few minutes.The visuals and building aspect are quite decent, if it weren't for a severe lack of resources to build anything big, and the process of going through collecting more is just way too tedious to bother with, especially since there is no gameplay reason to do any of it while being clunky to manage the inventory.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Ocak 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesii really wanted to recommend this game, sadly it lacks content and they make up for that  by having you do the same thing over and over and over so you rank up play hours.to me it looks like the devs listen up to hardcore survival players or it's actually intended to be hard for single players to force you to ask a friend to come and play and buy that extra copy .you can actually see the hunger/thirst bar going down, that's how fast it drains in this game, and after a while is not a problem having enough food anymore is the fact that you have to do it every 5 minso my play right now goes like this:wake up in the morning, kill the shark, mine the ore on the island till shark respawns like 2-3 min later, then go on raft, eat,drink, plant some seeds, repair raft, chase the birds off the crop, eat ,drink, chase the shark from biting raft, chase the birds of crop, smelt some ore,drink,eat,chase the shark , chase the birds, smelt ore, drink eat, repeat last 5 actions till night time, sleep, wake up ,do same stuff till crops are ready then kill the shark, go do some more mining come back to boat and do it all over again.all that so i can have an extra 10 ingots of metal to reinforce 10 squares of my raft , and raft beeing 15x15 i would need a lot of metal so i would probably 5-10 h just gathering enough metal to reinforce the raft , just like i did almost that to build the raft in the first place.so yeah if you don't have a group of friends wiling to play this with you don't buy it, the game doesn't scale difficulty depending on how many play a world and is heavy tuned towards 3 or more players.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Eylül 2022You play as one of two child geniuses who understand engineering to an astounding degree, who are even capable of improvising a makeshift bomb out of common every day items. :D The game runs on a good premise - a crafting/survival game where your raft serves as your base. Unable to build on land, the game encourages you to grow and build your raft from a pitiful 2x2 piece of debris, to a self-sufficient gargantuan monstrosity. That sense of growth and seeing the fruits of your labor is an undeniable dopamine hit. The music is also amazing, and the graphics walk the line between immersive realism and cartoonish casual very well.However, in my opinion, there are still balancing issues, along with some minor bugs. There were instances where my character would be swimming in the water, and then suddenly be teleported back to my raft - likely the Unstuck function somehow being triggered. There were also instances of items disappearing from storage, and entity AI malfunctioning. But, having played numerous crafting/survival games, the most difficult aspect to get just right in a survival game is the rate of hunger/thirst deterioration.I looked through many of the reviews and saw people commenting about having to eat and drink too often, and I thought, yeah, well, you see that said about every survival game. Unfortunately, after playing for myself, I have to agree say this is where Raft misses the mark.There are only 2 bars to maintain: Hunger and Thirst, however they both drain at a rate that ultimately detracts from the more enjoyable crafting and building and exploring. It is especially brutal in early game. As you begin set adrift, by the time you see your first island, your character will start coughing. Once you do manage to figure out the crafting menu, you'll still only have a small water filtration unit and a small plastic cup. But hey, you should be okay after a cup... make that 5 cups of water to fill your thirst bar. Uh, devs, that's almost a liter of water.You likely won't be able to disembark on the first island you encounter unless you manage to pull together a one time use anchor. But if you do, you also have the option of eating juicy fruits to fill hunger/thirst. Like, it only takes 6 pineapples, each the size of your head, to fill your thirst and most of your hunger. Most islands won't have that many pineapples. And the materials and time required to grow that many pineapples is still quite a bit on starting out. Watermelons are also an option for thirst. Just engulf 4 whole watermelons in one sitting. ""But have you tried fishing?"" Yeah, 5 whole cooked tilapia to fill your hunger bar. Catching that many will likely require more than one fishing rod as you'll want to save your pomfret and herring for shark bait.And speaking of sharks, want to get rid of that nuisance by killing it? Sure, but it'll just respawn a couple minutes later. At least your reward will be a novelty shark head and 4 pieces of shark meat.... and it'll take all 4 of those cooked shark pieces to fill your hunger. Imagine being so hungry you could eat a whole shark.Yes, there is a cooking stove, but those materials are relatively difficult to get early on and/or require prior meta knowledge if intended to obtained early. And even then, the meals/smoothies fill half your bar. How long does half a bar last? About a quarter of the day. So basically, on Normal difficulty, your char needs to eat at least two meals a day, or else they get so hungry they start to black out. xD And don't get me wrong, it's not in a ""dis gam too hard"" way. It's honestly a nuisance having to gulp down a small garden and a liter of water simply because you took a few minutes to organize your storage.The game doesn't really balance risk/reward very well. Other survival games present high risk for high reward. Take down a strong enemy, and you'll be able to craft something equally amazing. Raft has more high risk/meh reward. ""Oh... a novelty head to clutter my storage. How nice..."" Craft a basic bow and 6 stone arrows for 9 planks, 4 rope, 2 vine goo, 1 metal ore, 3 stones, 6 plastic. It will require the full set of 6 stone arrows to fell that effing bird that can kill you in 3 hits (hope you made more or you better not miss). Your reward is, tada, feathers. ._. Why not make the screecher head a material that crafts a helmet that protects you from falling rocks - making the next screecher easier and represents overcoming that challenge? The shark head could be used to craft an underwater breathing headpiece, or perhaps a mounted shark head could slightly increase the interval between shark attacks? Oh. And tool durability... It's just.... (deep breath) It's just not fun. :/The highlight of Raft is in building the raft itself. Although, I did also notice the build interface being finicky at times. The option to place an object will go in and out as the boat sways. (did the devs consider players would be building on a swaying boat?) But more importantly, it's fairly common to get immersed in the zen of decorating your boat... until your char starts coughing. How are you hungry and thirsty already after eating all those pineapples?! Other crafting/survival games have mechanisms for players to be able to enjoy building while putting off concerns of managing resources bars. Minecraft, the game that started this whole trend, only drains hunger when the player runs or jumps, allowing carefree building for hours on end. And when a char does get hungry, just a cooked steak or two does the trick.I'm aware this game only got out of beta a while ago. I'm not certain if there are plans for continued updates. Raft is okay for what it is, however the balance issues likely will chase away more casual players who just want to make a fancy boat. The building interface also needs work. Also, hey, this game makes sharks look bad. No self-respecting predator would behave like that. ;[A few other things- Ability to pause in solo play. Also pause while the game is minimized. Considering how quickly the bars drain, if you get a phone call while playing and don't exit to main menu, you'll likely come back dead. ""Don't Starve Together"" has done this - while not including pause during multiplayer - and it too is intended as a multiplayer game.- Support beams that can be placed diagonally. And for that matter, being able to place decorations and objects against diagonal walls. Did we learn nothing from the Sims 2?- More user control in building interface. That is, rather than waiting for the game to pop and connect objects- COLLISION! The physics engine is great, however if player's raft hits the tiniest rock sticking out the water or one of those abandoned rafts, it will spin the entire player raft around - regardless of size.- Why are crowbars and bolt cutters one-time use? ;[",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Şubat 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiHorrible game mechanics.The durability of tools is insane. Every single tool destroys itself after only a few uses, so you have to constantly re-craft things. I only needed an hour or so in the game before realizing that situation was going to be unbearable in the long run.Same for food and water. Nothing you eat or drink provides very much, and then to double down on that problem the sustenance they provide runs out in a few minutes, so you're double screwed.The shark is dumb. What kind of a shark attacks a boat?! A Steven Spielberg shark...This has to be the worst survival/builder game I have ever played. Started a couple games on normal and in both of the starts promptly ended up with my raft stuck against an island. No paddles, or sails could free them. The only solution was to start over.Take note of just how little playtime any of the reviewers have on this game.

Yayınlanma: 16 Ağustos 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game does not feel ready yet. I gave it a shot and played the early part of the game and it is more frustrating that fun. First the hook that you get is very clunky and have  a bad feeling to it. There is no minor adjustments you can do other than control the speed you drag it back. It would be nice if they polish this a bit and make i better. Just a small side-to-side would be nice and a longer throw when the bar is low.The next frustrating thing is the water/food intake. I hope it gets better later on but early game it is horrible. You need to get the grill and purifier which is manageable but to get your water needs back to full you need to drink a lot of water cups. This takes forever. You need so much water so you get hungry while doing so and you need so much food that your fishing pole almost break before you are full. And that is not all you need wood for each water-cup and each fish you grill so you will need more wood. And then the shark attacks and you need wood and plastic to fix your boat so you need to gather more wood but then you get thirsty again while doing so so you need to make more water and ... etc etc... The game loop here is not fun. I is too much time spent on food/water. I guess this becomes better later in game but then maybe the user should start with some food/water or make it possible to find fresh water in all the water buckets that float by.Anyway the game could be something later on but now the gameplay is not really good enough.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Ekim 2022I have zero idea as to why this game has so many positive reviews.I really wanted to like this game, but its just lacking in so many ways.Firstly, if you're considering this game as a solo players, stop doing that. This is not a solo player game.Secondly, if you're considering this game because you like survival games, chances are you are going to be disappointed for various reason. Theres a fine line in survival games between tedious and fun. Raft takes the approach of just making every step of the process insanely tedious.The main loop of the game is sitting on your raft (name drop!) and fishing for the debri floating by. You may think ""Hey now. That does sound relaxing. I like water and calm, easy gameplay."", but the big problem is that you move slower than a snail and you only move in one direction. Its literally like watching paint dry. Go get a water bottle and throw it as high as you can against a hot, dry wall. Now wait at the bottom of that wall with your tongue out and wait for the water. That is the Raft experience.The combat in this game is horrific. Ive seen higher quality in abandoned junkyards. It is THE WORST combat. Period. Out of all these positive reviews, I havent seen a single one mention the combat. Flash games from 2002 have better combat. The truly said part about that is im not exaggerating. How to kill a shark? Make a spear. Go underwater. Wait for a minute. Shark comes at you. Time the melee attack for the short window where the shark doesnt hurt you. Get extra stab in on the shark. Shark swims away. Wait for a minute. Shark comes at you. (You get the point right?) Do this for about 5-6mins every single time you wanna fight a shark. Oh and the hitbox and melee animations are super janky. Good luck.A key element of survival games is your hunger and thirst bars. Thirst in this game works fine. Get cup, get seawater, boil seawater, drink water, repeat. However the hunger bar in this game is ludicrous. Its like youre stomach is a bottomless pit. Eat a whole pineapple? Thats ~8%. How rare is food? Pretty rare. You arent guaranteed to find food on islands and often times youll only find a little bit. You can build a farm, but its just the same food you would find on the island. The best food early is killing sharks and the process of that is unfun.This is barely the tip of the iceberg of problems with this game.I tried to refund this game just under the two hour mark. I never got a refund, so I said screw it im gonna try and make it work and put in a few more hours. Id rather play minesweeper than this game, watch any movie, watch any youtube video, make beef jerky over and over, anything other than this boring, tedious, monotonous grind.",N/A

There's quite a bit of variety in the things you can build, and you're always getting better stuff.Unfortunately, the things in this game that pose as threats are really more annoying than intimidating. The shark constantly is trying to take a byte off your boat, and birds are constantly trying to eat your seeds. Fighting them isn't really fun, it's just a matter of running over when you hear them.As a result the experience can feel frustrating, and annoying. In addition progress in this game feels overly slow. Like a small amount of content spread out over a long time of gameplay.I really want to like this game, but the reality is that I don't. But who knows. Maybe the experience is better in multiplayer. I only played single player.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 26 Kasım 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiI didn't like this game. First of all it doesn't seem to utilize the iGPU more than CPU for rendering at this time which is going to be a major problem if you have a mobile CPU such as i7-8650U. With my GTX 1060 and this CPU combo, I've been able to play pretty much every game I've wanted with ""High"" settings and easily achieve 60fps. Not this Raft game though. Expect inconsistent 40 to 60 fps. So the performance is bad right now if you don't have a processor that can deal with it. Some laptop users are going to be in trouble here as a result, for a game that doesn't seem like it should be very graphically demanding. Secondly, the game just seems a little mindless and monotonous -- I played only hard mode with some friends, so this review is based on that alone.  I played for 101 minutes on ""hard"" mode and there were never any ships, we only had small islands. The task of just collecting the same things over and over in the ocean gets really old after a while. There isn't enough balance between items that you actually need vs items that are plentiful. There's tons of plastic and palms in the water,  which you'll be storing plenty of -- but not nearly enough wood. Might have been a hard mode thing though. Finally, I kept falling in the water and getting out was really clunky. I often just died, and respawning after being saved would sometimes just land me right in the water, only to die again. I'd have to quit and reenter the game at times too. The concept of this game is not bad, but needs a lot of work and isn't worth nearly $20 at this point.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiAh Raft, probably the closest thing to a ""neutral game"" in the history of steam, at least in its current state:Pros-Graphics are quite decent, even on low-spec PC's-Controls are pretty easy to understand, no ""useless"" ones unlike other survival games-The ""story"" seems to be on the right trackCons-The lack of content for a game that's been out for almost 3 years is quite disturbing. Even the most casual/brain-dead of gamers can probably get from a new file to the ""end"" of the current storyline in under 9hrs, and unlike similar games like harvest moon/stardew the replayability is limited-Combat seems super imbalanced, heavily favoring the archery/""ranged"" aspects and being near useless for the melee parts. With the bow also enabling triggering of switches and mechanisms over gaps, there's zero reason to not have a bow aside from gimmick runs.-For a game with all of these downfalls, $22 is a pretty steep price.TLDRUltimately it's kinda hard to give this game a positive or negative review. While it has good and bad elements, neither one really outweighs the other. While the game isn't for everyone, for the people it tailors towards (those who want to play a game once then ""sit"" on it until way more content comes out) it can be seen as one of the greatest of all time.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 9 Mart 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt's a mixture of boring and frustrating. You start with a hook for grabbing items, there's a shark that intermittently attacks your wooden raft and eats pieces off. At first you don't have anything to stop it, you can make a spear that breaks way too fast, just like everything else in the game. You can use the spear to fend the shark off but it stays around your raft the entire time, you can't jump in the water for 2 seconds without the shark coming for you. You can kill it after a certain amount of hits from a spear but it will respawn in 2 minutes.Anyways, most of the game early on is spent literally sitting  on a raft grabbing items like wooden planks. You'll start to get enough items to build something but then your hook or your spear will break, so you have to use your items to make a new spear, or repair the pieces of your raft the shark has damaged. It's VERY annoying and frustrating trying to make any headway in this game. It's also one of those ""survival"" games where you have to eat 20k calories a day. So basically you're sitting there picking planks out of the water one by one, using one or two planks just to cook a fish that barely fills your food bar. Getting more planks only to have to make a new spear or repair your raft. It's annoying. The shark is a terrible mechanic. Idk how people find this game ""relaxing"" because it's just extremely boring.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Kasım 2022You can definitely have fun with it if you play it with friends, and for 20$ it's worth it's price.BUT: maybe I'm a snob, but in my opinion it's a subpar game and got a little much praise. Or in other words: it's an average early access game. 6/10My critique points are:- collision physics are almost not existing-- drifting debris is clipping through your raft AND also through islands-- constantly being inside 2m high waves, while being on your raft, really destroys the fun/immersion for me- islands repeat very fast, there are only about 10(?) of them- the debris stream is so narrow and it's outlines are not randomized, to a degree that it brakes the immersion, because you very often see that it's a fake debris stream- debris does not move at all! it's locked to a position in the ocean, apparently there is no wind or current in the ocean of RAFT- the only thing which moves in the ocean is your raft, which apparently is moved by a magic wind/current (which does not affect the debris)- the very! low geometric mesh of the island where the designed sea-floor ends and goes into big chunky island-foundation is really unpleasant <- this could have been concealed with a reasonable effort- talking about the ground around islands: if you throw your anchor in a deeper area, the anchor just hovers in the water without touching the ground- textures with text have a bad resolution. Which becomes painfully obvious when you want to read them, for example at the trader- enemies behavior and attacks are as unnatural and stupid as it gets- the grind is huge (at least for my cup of tea)- hunger/food decay feels way too fast- some items like fishing rod, brake too fast- 3/4 of the craftable items are just cosmetics- physics for the raft are just non existing- put the sail anywhere on your raft, and it will move perfectly aligned to your raft- the floating-height of the debris or the fishing float does differ to the visual height of the wave, it looks like the noise-algorithm for the wave-shader is completely uncoupled to the noise-algorithm for the position of the debris (which is most likely calculated on the cpu)- IMO: they mixed up the color for the ore- copper-ore is brown in the game (but oxidized copper in reality is green)- iron-ore is green in the game (but oxidized iron is brown)- the ""story"" is bad for my taste (i only saw radio tower and V******n)- has really bad voice acting/quality of the recordings- is (even for a game) not well plotted- the ""run around collect A to get into B, collect C to get into D"" is not really compelling- at least, it's nice that they put a story into the game- and the encounters of the story locations are nice diversion from the same 10 islands you usually see",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Ağustos 2022The game is honestly a ton of relaxing fun (especially with friends), and I really enjoyed my time with it. That being said, after over 100 hours playing the game I find myself unable to get the last ""secret"" achievement no matter how many times I reload the save file and complete the last island. I've made a couple discussion threads about the issue and only once received a reply, telling me to contact the developers about the bug via a bug report. It has been a couple months since that report was made and I've received no further communication, so I've once again gone through and re-completed the final story island and I still have not received the achievement, leaving this game forever unfinished for me. I am planning on trying again some time in the near future but I do not have much hope.IMO, this game is 100% worth the money (especially on sale) and is a blast to play with friends, I just have to give this game a negative review because my personal time with it has come to rather negative end.Edit: 3 months later and the achievment still doesn't work for me.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Temmuz 2022*CONTAINS CRAFT-ABLE ITEM SPOILERS**CONTAINS END GAME SPOILERS*Main points for those who don't feel like reading all that: The enemies and combat completely suck the fun out of the game. The story isn't worth all the effort it takes to finish the game.The game-play is great! Raft is a fun survival game with an interesting art style and fun building mechanic. I would love to give this game 5 stars, a thumbs up, whatever, but the enemies completely ruin the game-play. It takes forever to kill the shark hunting your raft, and a new one re-spawns within not even a full minute. Sure, armoring your raft keeps it at bay, but trying to explore underwater AT ALL is a pain in the ass. Three bites from that shark and you're dead. Even the armor you can make isn't that great. The enemies found on the islands are just as bad. It takes forever to kill a single enemy, and the damage they can do is obnoxious. When you play a game, the enemies should challenge you, not be straight up annoying. And every enemy, including the benign seagulls, are F!#*ing annoying.Edit: I've since put a ton of time into a peaceful world. Putting the game into peaceful at least makes the main game play more enjoyable. Hunger, room to grow, and upgrading equipment still make for a fun challenge. My opinion after beating the game: the story is absolute garbage. You put in a massive amount of work getting to the final island, Utopia, only to be given MORE work. It takes hours of puzzle solving to finally beat Olof. You don't even get to put an end to him yourself, the people you end up saving just put him in a cage. After going through at least 4+ different puzzle sections AND fighting a main boss, all you get for all your effort throughout the entire game is a ton of vending machine tokens and some food. The vending machines only offer decorations from around Utopia, and you don't even get that much food. The marketplace Utopia has shows bushels of food (you only get +1-3 per bushel), and a ton of people. You'd think given Utopias size, they could populate all of Utopia. Maybe add in some traders, or quest givers to keep the game going; But no, only one small part of Utopia ends up being populated with useless NPC's. Sure, you get some useful blueprints, like titanium weapons, but what are you supposed to do with them NOW? All the large islands are identical (there are only 3 or 4 different islands that spawn), the small islands aren't even worth the stops, and there's no point in returning to previous quest related islands. The journey itself may be fun, but once it's over, it's over. It's sad that the game has to be put into peaceful mode to even make it playable. I probably won't even play this again unless they add DLC to make it more interesting..",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 ŞubatI want to love this game. I love the concept. This self sufficient raft building system and water exploration appeared to be a lot of what I love about Subnautica. But at the end of the day, I end up just wanting to play Subnautica. I think there is a lot of potential here. I've seen creations that make me want to dive in. But... the execution falls really short for me. The game doesn't really tell you much. Like, that if you lose your raft or get permanently stuck, your game is over because you cannot build a new one. So you think, I have a paddle. I can land on this island and get some wood and other stuff so I'm not spending endless hours fishing for it... Only to find out that there's like almost no proper collision model in this game, and your raft will clip into the island and get stuck. I was about an hour in, and then spent like 10 minutes trying to get my raft literally OUT of the island. Not off the island. Then I find out via Google that oh yeah, you HAVE to build the anchor before you even consider landing on an island. In other words, don't land on the island. So I had to start over. Sorry, but, come on. That's a mechanic that's there because of a limitation of the game, not a feature. I don't like that.Next up, the exploration ""fun"" is really hampered by that stupid shark and birds on the islands. You start off with a bad spear that breaks in no time (along with most tools). You simply cannot get into the water with the shark around. So you have to kill it. And you do this by essentially clipping through the shark's attacks and timing your mouse click. Yaaaaay. You do this many many times, often needing more than one spear. Get a bunch of meat, and you can explore. And within five minutes.... there's another shark. And they simply circle your raft. Oh and when you get on land, there are dive bombing birds that will attack you and kill you in short order that often you don't even see because you just start taking damage not even knowing why. Basically impossible to kill a spear alone.Next are the survival mechanics. Your food and water deplete way too fast. It often feels like 70% of what you're doing is grilling fish and filling a cup, and getting wood to feed the grill and water purifier.It would be different if the combat was nuanced or had levels of mitigation like other games, like The Forest. But here, the progression just feels so slow, and within just a few hours, the game seems to get very repetitive. Obviously you need to find ways to defend against the shark and such. But I just found myself losing interest. Having looked through the research tree and all that, there's just not enough material to unlock to really draw me in.Obviously, based on the review scores on Steam, I am quite the exception. It's how I feel with the game. I also don't like Don't Starve. I am very picky about survival games. I just feel like the above is what you should know before buying the game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 13 Aralık 2022As a multiplayer game, its a mediocre adventure game. Youre mostly gated by puzzle solving, combat resource gathering and even survival are minor gameplay elements in multiplayer.On the flip side, the entire game is based around multiplayer. Singleplayer gives you a frustrating experience bordering from trivial at lower difficulties to nearly impossible at higher. A minor thing such as animations prevent you from responding quickly to shark attacks. I could go over the hundreds of little nitpicky issues that culminate into a disapointing game, but honestly its just not worth it. Its a 6/10, if youre wanting a relaxed adventure game go for it. But if youre expecting survival crafting look elsewhere.Some games to consider: Green Hell, The Long Dark, The Forest",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesithe combat in this game really does overstay it's welcome. like it kinda works for the shark to the point that the shark actually dying feels like a neat surprise to what basically feels like your just hitting the shark a few times to make it stop attacking your raft. like it doesn't feel like something you're supposed to kill. because really making it stop chewing on your raft takes the place of killing it for the gameplay loop. but with all the other enemy encounters it's just... they all take too many hits to actually feel good. like the basic rat that you encounter should probably go down in one hit from the wooden spears.... it's like.... in games where you can drop enemies in one head shot feel really good when you get a head shot.... but games where you have to do like 10 head shots per enemy... head shots feel like a chore. combat in this game is a chore.if the hostile animals weren't ridiculous damage sponges this game would get a positive review from me. i love the exploration, crafting, and survival mechanics. i love playing this game with my partner. but i can't give a positive review to damage sponges. giving enemies large health pools is lazy design. if you want the encounters to genuinely be more difficult make the AI better. making it so it takes more resources and time to kill the enemies doesn't make those encounters more engaging it makes them more tedious and annoying.making it harder to get the one shot that's gonna kill the enemy is way more engaging than having to do a relatively easy shot 50 times. (especially if the weapon only has 40 uses before it breaks)and now that i'm thinking of it.... i'd really like to just be able to re-balance every aspect of the game.... because all the better gear feels like a complete waste of time.... metal axes and fishing rods don't feel like they last long enough to justify using the rarer resources on making them.most enemies should die after just one hit with really any of the weapons... hell if the enemies had significantly smaller health pools the single damage point increase between wood and metal spears might actually be noticeable.also it's annoying that it's either death is meaningless because you don't lose anything when you die... or death costs everything in your inventory because you can't go reclaim any of your stuff. like if i die in subnautica i can go back to where i died and get my stuff. and i hear it's the same for the soulsborne games which are supposed to be the pinnacle of difficult games.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Temmuz 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI really want to like this game. I enjoy survival and building games. I loved Subnautica which has some similar elements to this game. The problem is that the gameplay loop and challenge of Raft relies on everything needing to be micromanaged to an incredibly exaggerated degree and it relies on creating item scarcity  through whatever means it can, including very artificial feeling things like sand being difficult to find even on a sandy island. Hunger and thirst go down very quickly even on easy making you contantly run back for more. Your inventory and storage is severely limited, and so inventory management get very frustrating especially early game. The Shark isn't very interesting other than to keep you on your raft. He is just always there, its never a surprise to see a shark, and it feels more of a nuisance and contrivance to serve the game design rather than something menacing or an interesting challenge to overcome. The fact that once you kill him he practically instantly respawns makes his defeat feel entirely empty as well.I modded the game to lower hunger/thirst and increase storage stack size space, but then the rest of the gameplay was pretty lacking.  I did enjoy building and customizing my raft, and I did enjoy some of the item/crafting progression. Unfortunately the rest of the game felt empty. I found enemies and combat (both sea and otherwise...) in this game frustrating, poorly designed, and boring and I wasn't compelled to keep progressing.I guess in summary, for me the challenge in this game feels annoying rather than challenging or interesting.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 Kasım 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI'm going to review this early to see if my opinion of the game changes. Also prefacing this with a note that I've played Stranded Deep, a very similar game for a chunk of hours as well.Currently, the game seems alright. I do not recommend Normal mode to start. I feel like Normal should be Hard and Hard should be Hardcore.The game in Normal is unrealistic. And I'm not expecting perfect realism from a cartoon game, but your stats drop incredibly fast for almost any game. I pretty much have to eat and drink every 5 mins or less. In game time, that's probably only a few hours. I eat a huge watermelon and it barely sates me.I don't know what differs from Easy to Normal, but I'm really hoping things decay slower, and your vitals drop much much slower. I can stand scrounging for food, but it's hard sometimes when food is gated behind several different tools which heavily depend on pulling stuff from the ocean. This doesn't seem like such a huge task, but spawns are simply random. You could pull 20 planks out of the ocean before you see plastic, or a palm.This all without mentioning the mechanics that actively make your life hell... shark consistently attacking your raft. Oh, while the shark attacks your raft, a seagull which has just been circling your boat swoops down to peck at your crops which you direly need to survive.I will be trying Easy mode... The game does look fun and honestly the casual play is what drew me to it, but it just feels like a chore more than a fun game, at least on Normal. I'll update this if my opinion changes.If you are looking for an Ocean survival game that's decently realistic, go Stranded Deep.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 26 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesithis is a really cool game. the idea of bouilding and surviving on a raft by yourself and friens is great. but this game isnt perfect. its deffinitly not worth the 20$ being charged and there is still very little to actually do. there needs to be more to collect and build and there needs to be more complexity to the gameplay. overall i think it is great but overpriced.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 11 Kasım 2022For the record I love Subnautica, The Long Dark, and Green Hell. Something in this game just doesn't click with me, perhaps for the following reasons:- You can ""automate"" the collection of basic materials, but anything more advanced than that you'll have to do manually. It gets kinda repetitive collecting materials by running back and forth your collection nets and diving. Granted, it's a survival game on a makeshift raft that's constantly falling apart (and being assaulted by a shark), but it's just not fun for me maintaining it and myself like this.- It doesn't help that some of the wearable equipment like flippers wear out eventually. Quite a chore to keep making those stuff. It really doesn't feel like you ""leveled up"" the first time you get them. Compare this to Subnautica where you have a (better) sense of progression as you unlock more tech.- Related problem, there's no fear of permanently running out of food and water since resources are basically infinite while you're drifting in the sea. Compare to The Long Dark because (pre-made)food and resources are finite.- After making your raft shark-proof and/or getting stronger spears, the shark becomes more of a constant annoyance rather than a threat. Fighting the shark is literally just stabbing it before it bites you, then rinse and repeat. It's a chore to fight it, and It's also chore to make constant repairs to the raft and crafting shark bait before then. Similar problems with fighting other hostile animals.- It's a ocean-based survival game, but most of the time spent is on the surface of the water or on land. Diving is mostly for collecting stuff.- Literally no interaction with the weather. Rain or stormy, the only thing it does it waters your crops. Strong weather doesn't damage your crops, raft, or any objects you've placed in it, nor does make it too wet to ignite your planks.- You're off drifting in the sea and you're staving-off hunger, thirst, wild animals, and drowning, but I felt bored rather than in danger. I wanna experience being the fear of being thrown-off my shoddy raft because of big waves! The weather wrecking my stuff! A chance of burning my ship because of cooking/smelting in a freakin wooden boat!- Your crops are perfectly fine being immersed with sea water. I wish that could be part of the dangers of the weather, but no, the game doesn't care and your potatoes will grow just fine.- The game doesn't pause when you bring up the escape menu. I usually play single player, so this just goes to show that this game is mainly for multiplayer, and maybe why the whole gameplay is a bit labor intensive and repetitive.- IIRC there's no voice acting. Maybe that's one of the reasons why I can't immerse myself in the game. Add some groans or moans from hunger or thirst or something. Angry swears at the shark while it rips my raft apart!What's to like:- From my experience, it's NOT good as a single player game, but it's probably a lot more fun when played with others.- Build your own ship! Then again, there are only a few buildings that are actually usable and the rest are cosmetics. If you're up for building stuff for fun, then good, but if not, it's not that enjoyable. Also, because of the existence of flotsam and collection nets, which shoul encourage wider ships for maximum resource collection.- If you like the tropics I guess. As someone from and currently living in the tropics, I don't really care.",N/A

But ya know, fine, at least maybe we'll get to see some cool new items, some new ideas. Wrong again. Each little ""caravan"" has the same exact spawn points of one another which consists of; 1 food item in the top middle cabinet, useless scrap in 1 drawer (we're talking wood and plastic that you, by now, have 1000s of from the ocean) and MAYBE some random item (an arrow or biofuel or something) in a bottom cabinet.Perhaps there was something more worthy of a title update farther into this place but between the frustration of the bird pelting us, and trying to remember how to craft certain things to help us (remember its been ATLEAST A YEAR since the game had a major update) we gave up.This could have been such a great game.

"Yayınlanma: 7 Aralık 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game costs the same as Subnautica, but isn't even worth 1/10th of what subnautica offers. But it's still early access, so subject to change, but I highly doubt.The raft is obviously in the center of the game design. It's your mobile base. As with all survival/crafting games, you start with the basics and craft what's necessary - but inefficient - in order to survive. As the game goes on, you craft more utilities, and better everything, with more rare materials. You pretty much spend the whole game gathering wood, littered everywhere on the ocean. While having so many, many stuff in the middle of the ocean adds to the gameplay, it's also killing the immersion.But appart from the raft itself, it offers nothing substantial. No story, no real immersion, no atmosphere, no goal, no soul.You have your typical ""needs"" with clean water, food, health and enemies. Among them is the shark.The shark design is horrible. It's not fearsome, it's not challenging, it's a boring, timed annoyance that prevents you from exploring too long. It is clipping through reefs, rocks and walls ust to chew on whatever he can chew on, you or a valuable part of your raft. It's present to your side from the beggining of the game, and will never leave you. Respawning quickly everytime after you kill it.All in all, it feels like someone had a good idea with the raft, but everything else was quickly put in to fill the void and call this a game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 4 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiMixed review at this point. I do recognize it is a work in progress. I hope to update this review as more elements of the game are revealed.Why I would recommend this game:* The core game play loop is very satisfying – collect trash, build stuff, build raft, raid island, survive. And once yourself established a little, the core loop really comes into play, creating an amazingly engaging experince. It’s very easy to find oneself drifting for hours building up tools, food, and equipment needed and suddenly look up and realize there is a new place to explore.* The music is good – Very soothing and works well with the game play. Jannik Schmidt is an amazing composure and I plan on looking up more their work. I hope future updates include even more pieces like these.* Solid multiplayer experience – The multiplayer is well implemented and supports the game play loop well, while not diminishing the survival experience. My rafting partner and I were never at a loss for things to do on the raft even while it made the take load easier. I can see where groups of people can create entire floating cities.* Fun environmental storytelling – It is fun to see all the thought and creativity which went the story locations (when we can successfully access them that is – more on that later). It really feels like surviving a world coming back from the brink and following the trail of survivors. And while it does suffer from the Fallout 76 issue of lack of NPCs, it doesn’t feel like we are just following the trail of people who are all already dead.* Fully customizable controls – As far as I can tell all aspects of the games control scheme are customizable. I especially like that I do not have to use the same control for object in hand as picking up or interacting. This was well thought out and it is clear the developers have a lot of thought to the control scheme.*Raft building is fun – this is key. Building the raft up and adding newly discovered elements is fun and worth doing.That said, why I cannot (yet) recommend this game:* Bullet sponges suck – This is my number one issue with Raft. all the hostiles are bullet sponges and most end up being a massive waste of resources and time. They do not add challenge, just tedium. Thrilling stories are when a person is down to their last two or three arrows or spear jabs and can take down an unexpected encounter not: “And so after shooting 20 arrows at the bird, I had to run back to cover while I ate and drank and waited for my health heal, and then after my 53rd arrow and an hour of shooting, I finally took it down.” This is especially true when the bullet sponges are nearly impossible to hit. I am not sure who thought making a bullet sponge bird with near perfect bombardment skills guarding a critical story area was a good idea, but someone needs to let them know it’s not. Make the enemies less spongy and that would go a log a way to really improving this game. If resource management is important, then make the weapons wear out faster and have fewer arrows made per batch. Easy peasy.* The first-person shooting mechanics suck – Exacerbating the bullet sponginess of the enemies is horrible first-person shooting mechanics. You got a melee weapon, with no real sense of where the actual impact distance is or a bow, with no real sense of where the aim trajectory is going to be.* The enemy AI sucks – In addition to their sponginess and the horrible shooting mechanics, the enemy AI is flaky and gets easily borked. Or worse, is so unpredictable that one can’t actually prepare or line up a shot. A player’s best bet is to just is to strafe hop everything in the hopes of not getting hit while trying to land a shot.*The parkour sucks – There are points in the story locations where players must engage in first-person parkouring. However, Raft lacks critical elements needed for a first-person parkour game, most notably a sense of where my feet are or the ability to grab edges. Instead, the solution is to run-hop everywhere and hope to muddle through.* No local area network support – Maybe a small gripe currently, but it would sure be nice if I did not have to play through online servers when I want to game with someone in the same house. It really bogs down and lags out the game.* Lots of well laid out and interesting but ultimately empty spaces – There are a lot of neat spaces well laid out spaces, with little in them. Add in those annoying bullet sponges harassing you all the time, and they make a lot of spaces where one simply doesn’t want to much spend time in. Instead of thoroughly exploring the world and being part of the experience, I am urged to look up a walk through, hurry my way through story locations, and get back on water. I hope these spaces will become further fleshed out in the future and give me reason to return to them to explore them further beyond achievement hunting.Neither here nor there:* Graphics – while they looked nice when I started (there are a lot of options), even on a machine which meets re recommended standards, by the time I hit first story location I had to scale them way back. I admit that I am not playing this on a gaming rig, but it would be nice if meeting the recommended at least meant I could play the game at the default setting. Storms especially tax the system. If you do not meet recommended, don’t even bother. One friend tried playing on a minimum rig and could not even play on creative.* The full story – I have not completed the existing story, and it is not done yet. I will say I like what I have seen so far.* Survival mechanics – I like them overall, but dehydration and hunger occur way to quickly. They need to slow down a bit.* Plastic – there is a lot of it. I would hope there are more uses for it in the future, but even if there is not, it seems fitting. Just throw it all overboard after a certain point.Additions I hope for:* More character options – I am glad I at least have two options. I hope they give us more.* Some UI elements – Notably adding the showing keys bindings on tool bar would be great.Overall, it is a solid, working game. Raft game reminds me a lot of Fallout 76 in a way, but better. And while I cannot yet fully recommend Raft (because I simply cannot recommend games with bullet sponges). if you are needing a vacation game to do with a friend or two, Raft will do fine. I am looking forward to seeing where the developers do with the game. I am glad I was able to support them in this project.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 8 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiI can't recommend this game... Yet.The game lacks a field of view adjustment, which has left me--someone who isn't normally too bothered by constrainted FOVs--with some eye strain. For whatever reason, this game has caused me physical grief.There's no max limit to looking up or down, which can be incredibly disorienting. Not so much when you're on the comfort of your raft, but should you ever fall in the water... Well, which way is up? While somewhat true to life, I don't live on a raft, but I do play games to have fun, and being disoriented any time I fall in the water? Not fun, especially when there is ALWAYS a shark in waiting, guaranteed to take a bite out of you every few seconds, and ultimately kill you in three hits, at which point you lose everything on you and respawn on the raft. Mildly frustrating.These are two very big issues, in my opinion. Big enough that I've opted for a refund within 15 minutes of play time; I spent roughly 10 minutes looking for a solution to the FOV issue, and then 3 minutes filing for a refund.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Aralık 2018Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiI know the game is in early access, but my experience with this game is extremely negative and unpleasant and doesn't make me want to play anymore after the ~30m I tried to get into it.I play all sorts of survival games, having played a large amount of time in Ark, 7 Days to Die, Empyrion, Starbound, The Forest, Planet Centauri, all with my wife. We especially loved Terraria. However, this game feels like a downward spiral of doom right from the beginning.First off, there is no tutorial. You're on a raft, junk keeps going by, and there's a shark circling underneath you. You can try to grab it with a hook thing, and they give you various materials. Pressing lots of keys, I found Tab opens a menu of a sort, but couldn't figure out how to extend my raft at the time, so I made a science station thinking maybe it required some research. Immediately, the shark latched on to the raft portion with the science station on it, and I frantically ran through menu options trying to figure out how to hit it to get it to let go, but after a moment the whole segment broke off and I was down to a 3-piece raft. That's about when my wife joined the game, who immediately hated the hook you start with so much, she jumped into the water to collect things.We saw an island coming up, so I was hopeful we'd stop for a bit, except then our raft just bumped around it and kept going. My wife was off exploring the island, so I made a paddle to try to get back to the island and could not win against the current. Then I saw a different raft that was larger than mine, so I jumped off mine to try it out. A moment after getting on it, it started sinking, and the shark decided I was tasty and started chomping on me.After I died, it went after my wife and chomped on her as well. I respawned, with absolutely nothing, no idea where my raft went, and joined my wife on the island she had found. We continued looking through crafting menus, trying to figure out how to build anything. Then the entire island despawned below us, dumping us into the water. We died fairly quickly after that.We retried a couple times more after that. We finally figured out the hammer is supposed to let you build onto your raft more, but I had to be bobbing in the water nearby, at just the right angle, to get the new piece of the raft to appear in green for a flicker of a moment. So I'd tried to get to the right spot, spam click until it hit the right spot at the right time... and then died to the shark.Really just not a great experience at this point in time.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 12 ŞubatI had fun with the game because I played it with friends, but honestly, I can't recommend it. The progression in the game is so bad. You don't get stuff until it's too late to matter in so many cases. And other stuff is just laid out in a bad, grindy way. There's upgrades you literally don't get til the last island that makes them useless.We modded this game to hell and back and that made it better, but it was still just so slow on progression. It wasn't fun to keep playing. The story is kinda weird and boring and doesn't really engage you. It's just a bunch of notes you listen to. There's nothing very interesting about it. It's not worth grinding for.Honestly pretty disppointed after wanting this game since it came out. But I got some fun out of it.

"Yayınlanma: 20 Aralık 2019Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiSo I started my first session.Loaded in, had the luck to check my journal of what's going on.According to the journal, I'm a 'Forward Scout'. A Forward Scout of what? And why am I on a single 2x2 raft with no supplies but a hook that is attached on a rope? Where is everyone else?Anyway, started to reel in materials with the hook. Felt good enough. Though, why are there so many things made out of plastic and wood showing up out of nowhere? Did something crash nearby?At some point I noticed the shark circling the raft. Ah, the looming threat on the game art, I suppose. And already there. Lovely. Made dipping into the water much more dangerous right from the get-go.Then I noticed a small island showing up, then I realized there's a actual water current working with this, and before I could manage to build a paddle, I was slowly passing the island. By the time I did get one crafted, it was already too late - The current is too strong to paddle against it, so I messed up already.Fine. Reload. Another try.I got better with the gathering and crafting this round and made the raft a tad bigger. Cool.Another small island showed up again. This time I was prepared. With the paddle I managed to get myself right in front of it to hit the beach section of that landmass - Only to witness that the current actively keeps trying to 'shove' the raft around the island. I figured with having at least one section of the said still-small raft on the land, it would get 'stuck' there but I apparently need a anchor to make it work. Eventually I got it 'ragdolled' against the rocks and bamboo/sugarcane(?), though I do have to keep my eye on it every now and again.Found some food and flowers. Cool. Managed to make an axe and drop the trees. The pause between the chopping cycles is a bit big, but I can brush that off. Thought you could also salvage the logs that lie around, albeit perhaps for a lesser yield.I was left disappointed when I found out I couldn't.Anyway, threw out the flower stuff that kept filling up my inventory and ate a few things, since the hunger and thirst was creeping up very quick. Raft was still safe, so I took a dip around the islands to look for materials. There was a lot on the ground, making me wonder what did crash down around here again, given that amount of scrap I manage to pick up from the sea bed.But I had more pressing issues, as Mister Shark didn't leave at all after I hit the island and kept harassing me, oddly disappearing into the terrain where I couldn't even retaliate with the spear I fashioned on the fly.After I had enough being pestered by him, I swam back onto the island and made a fireplace and a box while it got dark.Kept the shark away from chomping on my raft with the spear, which showed the first time its effectiveness. Neat.When I got everything sorted out, I was ready to leave the island.But the game had something else for me in store.As soon I started to paddle my raft out of the corner, I (raft excluded) gotlaunchedacross the sea. I landed somewhere in the middle of the ocean, with nothing in view except water and the sunrise welcoming my soon-to-be-demise.And that's where I quit the game and got my refund issued.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 11 Eylül 2022Things that need improving for this game to cater to newcomers:- Larger inventory to begin with.- More food / drink options when not near islands to begin with.- Improved inventory management. Right-click food to eat should be possible including when it's not in the quickbar. This goes for ALL items that, for some silly reason, has to be moved to the quickbar and then selected there to be used. It feels very cumbersome and there are way better ways to do this that I would consider standard.- When you construct an item that needs placement, it's probably because you want to place it. Make it so!- Close proximity construction inventory!- Add keyboard numbers to the quickbar (why aren't they there?).- In stores, make it clear what you can, and can't afford currently. Right now you have to click each item to find out if you can afford it.- Same goes for the item construction menu. Make stuff grey when you can't afford it currently.- When there's no room for an item in your inventory, let the player know! Right now it simply drops on the ground behind you if you're moving forward. So you can be running around collecting stuff. And then after a while you'll look behind you and see the trail of stuff you thought you picked up.- When you're perched, play the sound of being thirsty once every 30 seconds... Not all the time, please. It's very distracting, especially when you're frantically trying to find something to drink.Game looks good and plays pretty well. But these things bog it down tremendously for new players such as myself. I keep putting it away due to it simply being bogged down by design problems.It's a shame for an otherwise pretty cool survival game.",N/A

It's like any other open world crafting game but due to the nature of floating along one direction on a raft, you don't have any control over what resources you're getting to build with and it strips the open world out of the open world genre.  If you're looking for survival crafting + lots and lots of chill, you will probably like the game, you float along, you build what you will with the resources you're given, and you explore the locations you float to, but if you're looking for something with a open world survival game play loop you're not going to find it here.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 24 Mart 2019Ürün ücretsiz alındıErken Erişim İncelemesiEarly access survival multiplayerSuper typical game, there are really many games with exactly these tags.

The same repetitive mechanics are reused in a really repetitive way, which makes the experience not worth the money. Late-game, stuff becomes really grindy and boring, which means that it's fun for the first few hours, while later it's super boring.It's extremely difficult to find other animals than sharks and seagulls, because the spawn rate of other animals are extremely low. The $20 is not worth it for the game, as the experience you are buying is basically like buying a super short game, since it's the same over and over again.Steam workshop would also improve the game a whole lot, since the community knows what's needed and would actually make an effort to improve the game.

"Yayınlanma: 24 Ağustos 2021I'll preface this by saying that I am an avid fan of Survival games and normally love the mechanics that survival games have, but this game has some absolutely terrible mechanical decisions.Point 1: The game doesn't tell you anything which in most survival games is a perfectly fine thing, since it allows you to learn through trial and error.What however completely breaks that concept is the fact that when you die in this game, it means losing everything you are carrying at that moment. And there is quite literally no way to retrieve those items like in any other games of this genre. Only if you are playing with a friend you stand a chance to be revived and not lose your items, which of course is not possible if you're playing Solo. If there is a way to retrieve your items, I would love to be made aware of this feature since it's clearly necessary, as most of not all other survival games do allow you a chance to retrieve your items for very good reasons. The game almost demands you play it with friends or not play it at all since one death can mean the loss of hours and hours worth of progress for no good reason, other than welp unlucky.Point 2: The enemies or more specifically the abomination known as the Screecher. Which I will admit is the main reason that I will never play this game again. this creature is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. it attacks by dropping rocks on you which would be fine if you could actually dodge them. Sadly this does not seem to be the case as I have somehow been able to be hit by these rocks when I was at least 10 meters away from the landing spot. I even streamed this part to a friend who couldn't stop laughing at how over the top large the aoe of that rock was (his words not mine.)Point 3: The  game is buggy as can get. the aforementioned part with the schreecher was combined with the fact that somehow for the umpteenth billionth time my raft somehow got bugged and ended up partially stuck into the island. I could move at best with a snails pace even with things like a sail and paddle to try to get me unstuck (I started avoiding the islands altogether because of this issue) and having to spend at least 30 minutes of agonizing cycles of respawn and death at the hands of the schreecher's over the top rock fall aoe, which again even when clearly avoided somehow still killed me.Point 4: This is honestly the biggest sin this game makes which if they fixed it they could make it so much better.All you really do is idly sit on a raft. That's it. no more, no less. Oh sometimes you get to spend like 2 whole minutes on an island and collect some resources you can't get anywhere else, but all you really do is be on that raft, doing almost nothing for hours on end. Honestly who thought this was a good idea? I mean I get the whole shtick of having a survival base that you keep returning to like all survival games tend to have. But this is literally you just being on that raft almost 24-7 where all you can do is collect resources (actively but very quickly you will just do that passively due to the nets you can attach) which again don't get me wrong that's part of all survival games but there is a limit to how bolted you can be to your base that it becomes more a problem than anything else. At least they could've given us an option to do some scout, or idk do anything else other than just sit on that darned raft the entire time with almost nothing else to do other than wait for resources to come in. If I wanted to play a waiting game I'd install an AFK mobile game.I mean even other games in the same sub-genre like Voidtrain at least allow you to leave your train on a regular basis to explore special areas, solve puzzles, etc. Being on the raft a good chunk of the game is fine, but when it's close to 24-7, it's not a good part of the game. And the game even punishes you for leaving the raft. Leave it for a little while while on the ocean: The shark will kill you. Try to explore and get too far away from the raft?: The objects around you just despawn, since items/islands spawning is tied to the raft, not you.There are plenty more issue with this game but i will not bother playing this game again until these issues are fixed. The game looks nice and has some nice mechanics, but the issues sadly very much outweigh the game's overall fun factor. Also the fact that this game is still considered Early Access after all this time is beyond comprehension.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 22 Ekim 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is an exercise in all of the most tedious survival mechanics out there. You can't really spend a moment even AFK when playing with friends, as your thirst and hunger go down too fast to ever feel like you can relax. A janky and buggy shark stalks your raft the entire game. If you manage to kill it, a new one spawns minutes later.

"Yayınlanma: 6 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is absolutely incredible, the survival aspect of having to fish, grow your own crops while building a moving base on a raft is just amazing.

You go through the story so quickly and will find yourself with no goal or fun things to do. As you can not prevent the shark from constantly attacking your raft there is no point in building a huge raft as it will be impossible to defend unless you're several people and even then i do not recommend it.The devs are also extremely slow at releasing new updates with content or just give general information about upcoming content updates. They'll usually reveal it just a week before they release it and then with several bugs, major and minor ones.However, if you do not mind the bugs, the extremely slow update progress go ahead.

"Yayınlanma: 17 Temmuz 2022I rarely leave reviews but... This is absolutely one of the worst games I've ever played.Stiff, stilted, half-arsed story with some of the worst VA's I've ever heard. The game has tried and failed to go beyond ""Build a raft and try not to die"" with janky map exploration, completely un-telegraphed puzzles, superfluous time wasting (run around and do X with no hints) and a combat system that feels like it was thrown in at the last minute, as an incomplete after thought.It's a spear. Not a dagger. They have *reach*The perfect example of unnecessary time-wasting is the death mechanic. You lose most of your inventory and that which you keep loses most of its condition.Another perfect example of unnecessary time-wasting is by wearing down worn gear. Not axes and hooks, but flippers, oxygen tanks, even leather armour (which is pointless.) By itself, degrading gear is a standard survival mechanic... but in raft, items deteriorate exponentially fast.As you come towards the end of the story, the narrative feels increasingly contrived and weirdly flagellant, stretched out with countless time wasting mechanics that add nothing to the game. Everything from cutting vines to the jumping puzzles appears just to exist to give the illusion of playing a game that simply isn't.Take Guild Wars 2's jumping puzzles. They are in my humble opinion, amazing. Not even the final jumping puzzle is within shooting distance of the worst jumping puzzle of FF, GW2, WOW, etc.I don't expect to be knocked off my feet. I also don't expect to have blatant time wasting rubbed in my face.On a final note: Imagine dying of first and deciding that, instead of moving as fast as you can to get to your drink (because the freshwater river isn't *drinkable*) your character decides to be 'exhausted' in a fashion that conveniently makes it very easy to be killed, thus losing 2/3rds items, which need to be re-gathered.There's a reason why hard games worth their salt all give you the chance to recover your stuff.Because they don't need to waste your time.",N/A

There is little thought put into making the story actually interesting, as the lore-locations are little more than a mish-mash of some characters we never see, having problems we as players can't relate to.Combat is a completely new can of worms in this game. With little in the way of weapon diversity, and no real way of damage indication, you're forced to pretty much brute-force your way through this games boring combat mechanic. With buggy hitboxes and awful enemy design, it leaves a lot to be desired. Most enemies come well stacked with leap attacks if you so happen to get far enough away from them, meaning that outrunning them is almost always impossible. And if two so happen to find you at the same time, you're as good as dead as kiting two bears at once is not a viable strat, with the only escape being to glitch yourself on a cliff and hope their pathfinding bugs out. There is nothing more to combat than kiting, and predicting enemy attacks as you step in for a white while they wind up their animation. There is little fun, there is no strategy, just mindless back and fourth until the enemy is dead.The raft itself is a neat, modular mechanic, leaving much to be desired. With little in the ways of upgrading, it leaves you wondering why there aren't more options as you can fully deck out your raft in a few hours.This is a fun game to play with friends, but at this point, it's not a valid excuse for bad game-design, horrible storytelling, and a combat system that does not match the survival aspect. If you plan on playing with friends, get this game, but as a solo experience, it's not worth the money.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 Kasım 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiFrankly, this game is barely mediocre. The combat is janky, the movement is janky, the same damn shark is the only threat to my survival besides my fellow raftmates. A vast majority of the game is waiting around in a boat looking for the same damn copy and pasted islands. If you disagree, sue me. This is just my personal experience. Maybe my opinion will change, and if so, my review will as well. There are too many better options available.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Mart 2021Raft is a survival game where you start with nothing but a plastic hook, on a piece of wood in the ocean (no idea why). Unfortunately, after 4 years in EA the game still feels basic, grindy and artificially extended. I spent 90% of my time scavenging food and purifying water. The other 10% of the time was spent fending off a permanently present shark. There's some great ideas in this game, but it's held back by busy work, poor inventory management and bad design choices. I don't think I could recommend buying it.Pros- Nice art style- I like that you start with nothing on a raft- Scavanging materials that float past you is an original idea- Islands provide a welcome respite from the constant journey forwards, although unrealistically if you miss them it's almost impossible to go backwards- Building a floating castle is fun, when you're not constantly being attacked by the shark- Quick stack into chests- Can quick-make basic components while looking at more complicated recipesCons- I don't think I could recommend playing on normal right now, it's really grindy. Constantly grabbing materials and drinking and eating just to avoid dying gets old really fast.- The shark is a bad game mechanic. I can understand why it exists but it's a badly implemented idea. If you turn it off, there's no reason to use the hook, and just jump in the water and grab resources. However, there is ALWAYS a shark in the water. Even if you kill it, it comes back 3 minutes later. It takes a huge amount of resources to create shark bait, which only makes it go away for 20 seconds. It attacks the raft every 5 minutes. Right now it's a cheap game mechanic that just adds a constant annoyance and distraction from doing something interesting.- The islands are interesting, but suffer from the procedurally generated problem, they're all basically the same- If you wash up against an island and you don't have the materials to make a paddle, game over. There's no way to move on.- No tutorial- No pause- My keys just stopped working randomly, so I couldn't change tools, or open the menu, or quit the game. Could still move around, but no other buttons",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 18 Ekim 2022Ürün ücretsiz alındıMy friend got me this game. I've been playing a lot of raft this week, and while it is a bit better with friends I've found it to be a frustrating experience. There's a lot raft does right but also a lot it does wrong.Things I liked:Raft is a survival game with a unique theme. Building the raft into something epic can be very satisfying and exploration is entertaining for a time.Eat the shark.Eat the SeagullsDiving the larger reefs for resources can be interesting. Like a watered down subnautica, pun intended.Things I didn't like:The shark while a constant menace also doesn't play by the rules. I generally start a dive by killing the shark, only if it buys me a minute or two, the shark bait really doesn't last long enough to be of use, sometimes shark ignores it. The most annoying thing though is if you don't deal with him he starts playing guerrilla warfare, taking a bite out of you then retreating, and he clips through objects and terrain. It's bad enough that he tunnel visions you, but having him constantly come out of the sand and clip through rocks is just an ugly problem.The game has terrible inventory management. This can be alleviated a bit by getting a backpack ASAP, but the game feels like 60% inventory juggling and raft inventory sorting. This is made much worse by the fact that your hunger and thirst bars decrease rapidly while you are trying to tidy your raft and inventory. There's also a LOT of button mashing, feeding fire powered buildings or recyclers can literally require you to mash E 30-100 times, and it gets really tiring. Most Buildings can only hold a small amount of resources at once, so it becomes a routine of running around your raft mashing E, juggling inventory, and opening chests to deposit refined goods.Food and Drink decay in this game are absurd, especially given the above point. I actually recommend playing easy mode just to take a bit of that problem away. By the time you've done a loop of your raft juggling things, you'll already be hungry enough to eat another shark. When encountering special islands it also becomes tedious to constantly be scarfing down food and drink, and not bringing an adequate stock can lead you to abandoning exploration to go farm/cook more food. Annoying.Cooking in raft is just as tedious as the rest. You must not only farm/catch ingredients while juggling inventory management and hunger, but go get clay to make bowls for every meal (which I guess you then throw away after eating, that or your character just loves the extra crunch). After you have everything you have to manually place all four ingredients on the cooking table and begin cooking, wait two minutes, and then use a clay bowl to gather your single portion. Very annoying given the high rate of hunger and thirst; having so many ingredients in your quickbar also contributes to more inventory juggling while cooking.Tamed animals get stuck in objects often, leading to them not feeding and ceasing to produce food/resources.Weapons and Equipment durability is just as bad as hunger and thirst. Oxygen bottles especially are quite bad, requiring significant time and resource investment to craft and lasting for maybe 10 minutes of diving. You will find yourself constantly having to craft new gear as the old stuff breaks. This goes for weapons too, crafting a bow or machette will give enough durability to kill a few sharks, then your weapon will break. Neglecting to carry a backup while exploring can lead to disaster, not to mention all the extra gear contributes yet again to inventory heck! Always carry a spare weapon and fins! Having a pair of fins or oxygen bottle break mid-dive is a good way to die, and given the decay rate it is bound to happen.Exploration is dull and the level design is poor. The main story has you explore several abandoned locations, the problem is a lot of these areas are huge and empty. For example I am currently exploring a submerged skyscraper. To get inside the main area I need to gather 4 spotlight bulbs to fix a spotlight to scare away jellyfish. Problem is I've searched the place top to bottom multiple times and only found two bulbs. I've gone through several oxygen bottles and fins in that time, and I've been at it for probably 2 hr. Most of the windows are broken in, along with walls in some places, but most of the explorable areas are just empty. There's nothing there, no hint of where to go, just empty room upon empty room while managing equipment and oxygen. This isn't the first time I've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuck in this way, with the bearboa island being a notable example. Looks like I'll have to go look it up in the wiki, again!There are also a very limited number of random islands you can encounter and get resources from. You will quickly see a lot of repeats and their simple design makes exploration rather dull after you've seen them a couple of times.Poor equipment information plagues raft. One of my top examples is the radio receiver and antennae you have to build early game, which have hidden requirements and no instructions. I struggled with warnings of ""Wrong Altitude"" on my Antennae, wasting a ton of resources building a 10 block high tower. Finally I looked it up on the wiki and it said the antennae must be located 2 blocks high. I did so and it still didn't work. Turns out 3 blocks was the magic number. I also had issues with warnings of ""Too close to another Antenna"" and ""Too far from Reciever"", if you didn't plan ahead in your raft design you are likely going to be forced to conduct some awkward renovations to accommodate them. It's ridiculous to have so many requirements on placement and have no indicator on what is correct. This is not the only time this happens either; When I finally unlocked engines I built two and wondered why they weren't working. Turns out you need one for every 100 foundations, which is only indicated by a crude pictogram. Animals need grass plots but if you haven't unlocked it yet there's no indicator of how to feed them. Apiaries need flowers planted nearby to start producing honey, but only produce a little honey unless you have 12 flowers (which is explained nowhere). etc etcIn summary, Raft has a lot of potential to be a fun survival game but is marred by all it's design faults and idiosyncrasies.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 8 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiSave yourself the frustration. The game plays great but once players hit a certain point they must traverse larger islands and the mechanics break in half. The player is far to slow and the threats are far to high. To top that off the game auto saves 1 second before death so you are forced to respawn and lose everything in a single player game, I am not at all sure how the 8 man dev crew can talk among themselves and come up with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

"Yayınlanma: 27 Eylül 2022This seemed like it was going to be a fun game....it definitely isn't. There are so many annoying things about it....I think the biggest one is the constant hunger and thirst that leaves you having to eat & drink every few minutes or die. Secondly the weapon/gear wearout is beyond ridiculous. You make a spear, great! Better make 5 backups because that spear will last you about 30 minutes tops before it breaks and you need to make a new one. Same thing with things like the scuba flippers....swim around for 5 minutes after anchoring your raft and BAM...your flippers are gone because they wore the frick out. Just like this game does to your will to live. Lastly, once you really get into the game and start discovering the islands in the journal, the puzzles...oh my GAWD the mazes & puzzles are enough to want to make you kill yourself. The final straw for me with this game was the dome island city where you have to move the boxes around with the crane. I couldn't do it. I'm pretty sure it's rigged and it's just an impossible task. I literally said F it and uninstalled the game after getting a massive headache and nearing a panick attack. If you're thinking about buying/trying this game let me just save you the trouble...don't do it. 0/10",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Ocak 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiLooking for a chill survival game? Well, keep looking.I wouldnt even call Raft a game. In games, you play, you explore, you have fun. This is more of a boring, hollow experience of you standing on a raft thats drifting on a stream - all you do is fish for whopping 3 types of main resources and when you've wasted enough time, you get to click on something in the crafting menu.Yes, once a day the game spawns you an island where you can get some more stuff, but due to the stream mechanics, exploration is more punished than it is supported.Also, your character apparently has a very bad case of tapeworms, as the amount of food the game forces you to shove down your throat is hysterical.The price tag is also way off.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2022Got hooked by the premise and the hint of a story in the in-game notebook. But the game falls flat in the first hour. There's no tutorial, which is part of the enigmatic appeal of some survival games, but given how easy it is to softlock yourself the game desperately needs one. Resources only spawn in a radius around your raft, meaning if you lose the thing you have no way to collect items and progress. You can't build a new raft either, only extend an existing one, so if the shark gobbles your raft up you are once again out of luck. I wouldn't half-mind these choices if they were communicated in-game through a tutorial or additional end-states. But they're not, and so they come across as bugs more than they do features.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiQuite enjoyable for the first few hours, but then the pacing of the game becomes apparent.The rate at which your character burns calories is a bit tedious. You'll be engrossed in some small building project, but will constantly have to stop to munch on your cooked beets 'n fishies 'cause apparently being stuck on a raft comes with a tapeworm.Also, the overall way you progress through the game will become an annoyance. After a few trial and error starts, I got off to a good start. I stopped by one island almost immediately, but did not know at that point that I would need wet sand to unlock certain research. After almost 3 real-time hours, I have still not spotted another island. I've done all I can, but the RNG is just not giving me an island, stopping any further progress. So I'm stuck poking sharks and watching seagulls.Now don't get me wrong, the game is an excellent roasted potatoes and boiled water simulator - but as an engaging survival game with satisfying progress, it leaves alot to be desired.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 25 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhile I like Survival Building games and this is an interesting concept, I have issues with this game. I realize the name is Raft, but if you stop on islands and can gather materials you have to be careful. The problem with it is that the spawn is set to the raft rather than the character. If you lose the raft while exploring an island because the stupid shark eats the spot your anchor was, you are dead in a bit because the island de-spawns instead of letting you make another raft. I also have an issue with any game that doesn't let you pause. This game is not good for single player if you have other things going on. The story seems interesting, but I can't get far as I have too many distractions to be able to fully invest time in the game.",N/A

Already knowing that the game will never finish and I will have to keep doing the same things over and over forever until I fail, made me lose interest.I didn't get much satisfaction from improving my raft (especially the cosmetic side), and while the game overall is well done, I felt like it was lacking a lot, it strongly resembles a mindless mobile game: collect resources from the sea, grabbing materials around islands, eat, upgrade, repeat... For example, there could be much more focus on islands, making them deeper and more mysterious, a place where you can explore but also stop and relax for a while (maybe have some sort of dungeons with enemies and possibly puzzles which would be dangerous but rewarding, either with story or crafting blueprints). There could be more focus on fishes and fish combat, making it more challenging and interesting, and the underwater flora could be much more detailed.

Instead of making the game challenging and rewarding players by letting them reap the fruits of their labors, the developers decided to make it as annoying and stressful as possible. There is never a moment of peaceful contemplation where the player can fish in the moonlight and just enjoy themselves. If at first the player just has to pluck debris out of water and fight off an annoying shark that keeps attacking the raft, eventually the micromanagement expands to keeping a water purification system and grill running, planting, watering, and harvesting crops, and chasing seagulls away, all while continuing to collect resources, researching new things, and expanding the raft. It is just a constant non-stop marathon around the raft. If all of this wasn't enough, the sharks keep multiplying over time and if the game starts with just a single shark that is easy enough to keep at bay, eventually one shark turns to two, and then three. The sharks always attack at the same time and usually target the same area, making it impossible to prevent them from getting away with a piece of a raft. And these attacks are constant, every two to three minutes, with at most five minutes between respawns when you manage to kill them. As a result, the game quickly devolves to fighting sharks and repairing the raft, leaving no time for collecting resources, or anything else, really. There is simply no enjoyment to be had in Raft and it is a shame because it could have been an addicting adventure through Waterworld.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 24 Kasım 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI couldn't decide whether I should recommend it or not. Survival games are my favourite but Raft seems very bland to me.

I would love to see more sea creatures that you actually interact with. Maybe dangerous jellyfish? Also would be great if sun was doing damage if you stay on open space for too long so the tent serves its actual purpose.For now Raft seems kinda boring to me but probably I will try it again when more updates come.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 29 Eylül 2022Played in the hard settings with a couple friends. We managed to survive but its really tedious. Your upkeep gets to the point where you cant do anything but farm and make fresh water, just so you can keep into the game. That and the sharks constantly breaking your stuff, the birds stealing your crops or whatever they do. You literally have no rest in this game. The game is really geared towards creative mode, but then there is another problem... Creativity is a bit hampered by the lack of tools and blocks to make it really interesting. Granted, I didnt play a hundred hours in, but truth is, I didnt really want to. Will try to get to the end game later but so far, Its been a boring experience.

"Yayınlanma: 1 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiPlayed with friends for a couple hours, immediately got bored and went to play something else.  Even on the hardest difficulty, the game provides little to no challenge.  The only real challenge that the game creates aside from the other difficulties is you need food and water more, which is just boring and time consuming.  What a waste.Edit: After playing this game a lot more, it does really pick up after a while, but that's the problem , it takes a while.  The main fun part of the game is going out and exploring once you get a receiver and antennas, but that takes a while.  Another gripe I have is that the combat in this game isn't very difficult or anything, it's just annoying and tedious as the enemies aren't challenging, they're just damage sponges and that's about it.  Also gathering resources is mega tedious because it just takes forever and you're constantly needing more and more stuff, and this is especially annoying and demoralizing if you play alone.  This game is a lot more enjoyable if you play with friends, since getting resources is often times much easier if you have people to help you.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 4 Ocak 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiAt the moment, this game is quite boring after a few hours even with friends.The gameplay loop is the same for early game, fight off a shark, fish for food, plant food, fight off seagulls, gather materials, repair raft, improve raft, see the same 4 islands, see the abandoned rafts.This can be okay for the first few hours before it just gets boring and annoying. Why are weapons poorly balanced? Bows do terrible damage for what they are, the difference between a wood spear and metal is just a single hit when damaging the shark.Worse part is that items only start to generate after a amount of time passes when you travel in a direction. This isn't a bad thing, it just seems quite awkward in practice.The game could have been better if the islands had something WORTH while to find other than the very rare plastic loot crates that give such average loot. If island sizes where randomized, and had randomized amount of items and such (Plants, trees, ores, etc; maybe underwater ravines and caves.); this would vasty improve the game.Another problem is the fact that the shark respawns a little too fast. Maybe if the respawn timer was around 10~15 minutes it would have been fine, since it respawns too often.Maybe the ability to control things about the game would be nice as well, such as how often you want to see a island or if you want hunger and water to decrease or increase less or more; even a damage multiplier for the player or the enemies. Settings you would normally find in games like Ark or Conan Exiles.There was also a bit of a desync issue in multiplayer where my friends couldn't pick up items or couldn't get out of the bed. Some times they lost their items randomly.I will return to this game in the future once some of the issues are fixed; hopefully mid way through early access.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Temmuz 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI was going to recommend this one, but then I continued playing, and the more I played, the less I was inclined to recommend it.This is a straight forward open-world building survival game, it’s a very overdone style since Minecraft, but also quite enjoyable when it is done well. So let me break down what works and what doesn’t here.Open world is all about exploration, which this game makes quite interesting by playing with the idea that you are adrift in a raft with a series of small islands to find and explore. It certainly solves a lot of problems to create a procedural world. This works well, although it still needs development and expanding.Building is probably where Raft shines, as the concept of a mobile base is great on itself, but researching and finding more schematics takes the player much beyond what him/her would expect from the start. I loved building my raft into this complete and self-sufficient base.Survival does not work in Raft. There is very little incentive to stay alive, which is OK since the focus is not the character, but the base. Except that I found that the best strategy in the early game is to save your inventory in a chest and die of hunger or thirst, rather than try to keep well fed. The game has a ridiculously taxing maintenance effort for about everything in it.Here’s a list of my routine every time I am back from a quick exploration run in a large island:-	Cook-	Refill water filter-	Refill sprinklers-	Check sprinklers batteries-	Tend to the animals (pick eggs, milk, wool)-	Fix shark attack-	Harvest-	Replant-	Water crops-	Check for seagull damage-	Collect the honey-	Collect biofuel-	Refill biofuel processor-	Refill smelter-	Refill firewood in the grill, cooking pot and smelter-	Organise inventoryWhile doing all this, usually there’s more shark attacks and seagull attacks. After all done, I can go back to play for a few more minutes, unless I’m running out of fish, wood, or something else that I need to farm.Games usually deal with this with automation, which this one does well for a couple items, as is the case of the shark attacks and fuel distribution. The problem is that everything else is still a lot of work.This is not a particularity only to the late game, early one food and water are huge problems, as is manually collecting all material from the water, but I can put that on the “challenge” brackets. Late game though, it’s too much unnecessary and not fun maintenance that the only challenge it provides is not to get bored.",N/A

Sure there are islands and the only danger you face is starvation and that stupid shark that destroys your raft from time to time but thats it.Simply another overhyped survival game that no one needs. It's still in early access tho, the future will tell which path this game will go. But for now it's simply boring. However, I could recommend that game to kids.

"Yayınlanma: 2 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiMy old review is below. The game is now out of early access and into it's final chapter. Here's the thing, none of the things that were problems before were changed. You still need to eat dozens of potatoes a day to stay SLIGHTLY ABOVE STARVING. You start the game with no way to make fresh water. The entire game is just status bar management hell. Managing status bars isn't fun.And if you don't manage your status bars perfectly, and you die 2/3rds of your inventory still MAGICALLY and RANDOMLY vanishes. Why? You can drop items on the ground, and on the raft, and in the ocean. Why do the items vanish into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aether instead of being DROPPED LIKE THEY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SHOULD BE?!?! ♥♥♥♥ me for trying to gather resources, amirite? I'm done with this game, if you didn't buy it when it was popular, there is no reason to buy it now.This game had such promise, then it turned into just bottom barrel survival game junk. I would love to get thru the story, but I'm not going to beat my head against this wall because it's just not fun.---The game is fun, however, remember its still in early access and there are some bugs. I recommend this game, but if the developers are reading, there are some things I would like to see addressed:-This game suffers from the same hunger/thirst problems all survival games have however. I don't know anyone who eats 8 times a day, and I'm sure the developers don't either. Paddling towards an island or abandoned raft takes long enough as is, but when you have to stop every 10 minutes to drink or eat you lose so much progress as the tides carry you away. If one thing goes wrong, like your paddle breaks, you simply can't recover the progress and have to float away and hope that the next island goes perfectly so you only have to manage your hunger and thirst.-Food doesn't add enough to your hunger to begin with. Eating 6 potatoes barely fills the hunger bar, but have you actually tried to eat 6 whole potatoes? It's the same problem with Ark and eating hundreds of berries to stay slightly above starving.-Ability to rotate your raft needs to be added. I spent hours setting up nets to catch resources, but the first raft I bumped up against put me at a the worst possible angle to collect loot with them. Paddling in the direction i wanted to go didn't actually change the direction my raft goes, the second I stopped paddling the raft would continue in the same bad angle.-Autosave.-Save world/load world has lots of bugs in it. I loaded in once and my character instantly died for no reason, losing my inventory. Other times I've loaded in and my inventory is just gone.-When you die your body should be left behind and it should have your loot. yeah most of the time it will float away as the raft travels, but when the raft is anchored, or you die on the raft from starvation, I still expect to get my loot back because I can go back to where I died. You already punish the player with a death, don't punish him with an hour of progress lost as he rebuilds his tools.But like I said the game is still in early access, so I expect much will change about the game before it's release. It's shaping up to be a solid survival crafting game.",N/A

No - you are not allowed to do that you must be the floating leaves instead.World with infinite trash floating - how immersive.. if it was crashed ship then that would make sense to see some trash float around..but here its just infinite...The shark that is so scripted you wont be able to get rid of it by random world seed. Its just always there.. And only one shark.. not 10sharks not 20sharks.. no dolphins.. nothing... It feels artificially scripted.It might be something good in late game but with such crude drawbacks this game should be avoided.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiSuper boring and grindy. If you want to throw a hook trying to grab stuff for 6 hours go ahead. These types of games are never fun, just trick your brain into feeling good because you feel like you're progressing building your raft, but ultimately it's useless. There's not much stuff to craft either. 20 bucks for something like this is thievery. If you end up buying this game, load in a world and look down fully. Your head can literally spin 360 vertically. This screams amateur developper like crazy. I don't trust them to make this game funner.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Aralık 2022Sadly the game does not click for me.Especially early game and alone one just dies over and over without being able to do much about it.Constant shark attacks, trying to manage water intake (finding enough wood and plastic for raft repair and to make water plus maintain tools) and not finding enough food one can only very slowly expand the raft.It just feels like idle busywork with very minor rewards. (I could set the game to easy or peacefull, but that removes the challenge mid and late game completely sadly)Once one gets going after a few hours like this it gets a bit more easy managing things as one has nets to help with collecting and enough storage to store excess items to maintain the raft and not die so often.I have seen the movies from just after that when survival gets manageable and even fun, but for me not being able to survive due to randomness early on not giving enough food drops sadly does not entice me to play onwards.This game is probably best enjoyed with friends together each taking turns to die and respawn and help build onwards till the raft is big enough to sustain the group so one can start adventuring.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 27 Haziran 2022Just a quick downvote to so-called ""released"" game. Deverlopers decide it's a time to remove ""Early Access"", I decide to try this game and..- No tutorials, you are just dropped in the middle of the ocean on a 4 block raft floating through some debris to a first isle accompanied by a shark... even Minecraft had kind of tutorial/quest to easy your start... this game offers absolutely nothing to beginners like me.. I need to again google and google.- No tooltips. No settings are explained. No crafting stations are explained. No way to unbind a key. I don't know how purifier works, I can't figure out what to do with recipes (and I build research thingie)... Sure it's all my fault, because I am a stupid person who play the game without watching few hours of lets play videos (sarcasm).- Bugs. A LOT OF BUGS. Starting from credits window which upon opening is scrolled into a middle and finishing the raft floating through the isle, The game may pause when opening menu or may not (I couldn't figure out how pause is supposed to work). The game can't even remember setting ""no friends can join"" when loading world. It freezes few times when playing with settings as well..- Poor optimization. I set everything on minimum, but fps is just floating so terribly high when simply rotating camera around: 60 (vsync) and then drops to 40.. Why??? GPU is at 100% no matter of settings, what this game is doing???- The survival aspects are just terrible. I tried easy and still game is too fast paced for my taste. The hunger/thirst meters are going way to fast down. The whopping 25 slot inventory become full way too quick and despite I ignored certain loot it was full pretty quick. The basic required staff will occupy roughly 1/3 of available space. And I didn't even had resources to craft very first storage...- The enemies.. The always following you shark, which I can't kill and as I read it will anyway respawn.. Shark make exploration aspect of the game very poor on higher difficulty. On easy I just ignore it completely (lets talk about balance?).- The raft will gets slowly eaten.. Every 10 or so minute one piece will gone. So you need that much to compensate by building it. And to build you need plastic. Good luck with stopping gathering precious plastic for a minute or so...Sure the game was in early access for 5 years and maybe it's too long. If it was released in a current state without early access I wouldn't complain. I'd give developers a time and chance to fix it (you know the ""No Man's Sky story""?). But if game suddenly become 1.0 while polishing and QoL-ing is far far until the end, then the reason is very simple - money. The studio running out of money and they already (more likely long time ago) started working on another title. Means this game will not get fixed and will stay a shame for a studio as ""Medieval Enginieers"", as ""Planet's Explorers"", as many others EA games.... We should stop buying EA games. Too much scams and disappointing. Too much excuses ""oh looks, the game is EA, why blaming it, just wait"". And then ""7 years to die"" titles around with outdated engines or devs, who just gave up and want to move on...",N/A

For almost $30 I expected there to be more than 3 different kinds of walls (wood/mossy/metal). The game is a really basic premise - you're on a flat raft, you build stuff on it, a shark attacks you constantly - and never really expands beyond that. It's rather difficult if you play normal difficulty, and I think that obscures the lack of actual content in the game, which becomes really evident when you play the sandbox/free build mode. It bored me in under 30 minutes - you can build a house, but even the customising aspects of that are very limited. You get bland color painting and like 3 types of walls/doors/roofs to work with, as well as a bunch of furniture. After that there's nothing to do.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 10 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiMultiplayer Early Access ImpressionIm in a love hate relationship with survival games. They tend to scratch something deep down i loved watching tv shows about these topics as a kid. With modern pressure about exams, work and love life it feels in a way being a huge novelty to go back to use most of your time just feeding your basic needs. Problematic is this if this novelty quickly wears off and im left with nothing but simple boredom which is rather rare for me due to the sheer amount of entertainment a man can get from the  internet.ImpressionStarting raft feels great, youre on a very brim situation, being on a small piece of debris trying find ressources with your only tool aviable while being completely at natures (and RNG´S) hand. The beginning is really hard just as any other survival game or life situation would be. Most of the time you need wood for everything. Bulding, crafting and burning it to make things that make you keep on living. Realism about the game aside my suspension of disbelief is at its peak. Im totally invested into the game, trying to make my living not as luck bases and not being completely at mother natures hands. You build sails and an anchor to explore.After that it becomes incredibly easy. The early game is only punishing due to amount of wood you need but don’t get. At some point you can get metal reliably and craft antennas to pinpoint story related islands. Then it becomes quite fun  as each island or story related place in general seems interesting and has something unique to them. Exploring them and doing tasks there to collect all story pieces is what I liked most about the game. And building your own raft that not only functionally but aesthetically pleases you.The main story can be played trough at this point way too quickly trough and after 20 hours you have either found or already build everything you can find, except the rare collectibles. Then it became mostly a big grind, either you do achievements or try to make your raft even more aesthetically pleasing.I feel like the combat itself is mostly dumbed down to shoot arrow and dodge left or right until dead. Serviceable but that was never the main point of the game. There is a shark that is rather annoying than dangerous due to him always to bite off a piece of the raft. In order to defend against him you need wooden spears which in turn again cost even more wood. In lategame hes just a nuisance. In order to stop him you need to grind a lot of metal which makes a lot of people just use a mod that stops him from doing that.If the dangers of surviving are gone what are we left with? Routine and work.  When surviving isnt a problem anymore the only challenge of this game is gone. After that when you explored everything the game offers, which is rather quickly, boredom again sets.My biggest problem so  is how most items in the game have barely any usage except for one. With wool you can make leather armor which right now is useless. Cooking with recipes to create dishes itself isn’t worth the effort when just fishing and directly cooking does it faster and it has less work required. There is a neat fuel and water system which is rather barebones yet but I see that it can make a foundation for some cool new items.Aesthetically wise the game is great I especially loved the soundtrack which i really loved due to its supporting my feelings while playing the game. Its a not so empty vast world to explore.ConclusionI feel like the game isn’t worth that much to buy yet. My biggest fun factor in this was exploring islands and that part was over very quickly. So, I suggest waiting for some new content before buying the game as the other aspects like the survival elements or combat so easy or it has just the basic things implemented. A lot of features are either barebones or generally bad or useless like recipes.  I don’t recommend to buy the game right now but to check it out again on release becuase its not clear if they can make the balancing right or add new uses for a lot of items.",N/A

Luckily, the ocean is absolutely littered with ♥♥♥♥, I mean every two meters there's a piece of trash ruining your screenshots. Almost as many sharks too, which is a major annoyance, especially since there's no other life in the sea. There are weird little rocky islands to go to, or after you progress your build tree you can find an oil rig; keep searching and you'll find a large island and think after all these hours you finally hit the jackpot, time to get some real work done on the raft- but no, you can't cut trees for wood.

"Yayınlanma: 28 Ocak 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiUPDATE:Devs blocked offline play in 1.0 and I'm changing my review to a thumbs down.Don't mess with your community, devs!!***I'm extremely torn about Raft. This review is for people considering picking it up but on the fence. I give it a tepid thumbs up.At a basic level this just fails as a *survival game*. The enemies are stupid and *annoying* as hell. If you die on Normal mode you lose your inventory as a ""penalty"" and you cannot go and recover your things like most similar games.Overall the design has significant flaws that seriously hurt the gameplay.Tip: If you want a zen experience and like building things and discovering things, play on Peaceful.On Easy and Normal mode this game gets a big fat thumbs down.CONS:The gameplay loop is very repetitive and can be very grindy.The gameplay makes very little sense. The mechanics are stylized and non-realistic in the extreme. Why do I need to pound on the sea bottom for 5 seconds to gather *sand*The world is empty except for a very small number of creatures. Why so few fish in the sea!?The enemies are ridiculous and ANNOYING. The enemies do the exact same thing every single time on an exact schedule. The shark attacks your raft after some specific period of time. Your ability to fight him off is annoyingly limited.PROS:It's very pretty and the graphical design is great. The water is awesome.The construction is fun.The Peaceful mode is absolutely the winner. Survival modes are ridiculous.Very zen-like on Peaceful.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 14 Kasım 2022This is a good game.  However, the difficulty settings for singleplayer are stupid to the point of being nearly unplayable, and arguably mostly due to the devs' laziness.  Easy mode is extremely easy, and the next level up is absurdly punishing during the early game - you lose almost all of your progress for the first ~1h of the game unless you're really careful (and spend resources which you need for other things).  The level after that is perfectly fine for multiplayer but basically hardcore (one-life) mode for singleplayer.  If the respawn conditions were all that were affected by the difficulty setting, I wouldn't care as much - it'd be nice to have something between ""lose nothing, and usually gain thirst/hunger"" and ""lose most of your stuff with no chance to get it back"", but at least you'd be able to choose which you wanted.  The real problem, and the one that should be trivial to fix, is that the hunger/thirst rates and enemy strength are both tied to the same difficulty setting, so there's no way to increase the rest of the difficulty of the game without getting the harder respawn conditions.  Every other game I know that has a hardcore mode has at least a hard mode which is essentially the same minus the one-life setting, if not making a fully independent set of difficulty sliders.  This game drastically needs independent difficulty sliders - hide it under and advanced button so as not to confuse new players if you want but put it somewhere, please.  Until then, it gets a not recommend from me, because it doesn't seem like the devs are going to care otherwise.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 22 Aralık 2021Horrible game if you like survival game. You are often times confined to your raft at long periods of time - the premise of the game of course - but are always lacking materials to build and inventory management is a chore. No room in chests and you cannot craft from them, so get ready to rearrange often.The game saves when you die - awesome - you loose everything on you. I needed one leaf to make a rope for building a chest (which is one of the many many many spring cleanings you will have to do) and had a lot of loot on me after visiting an island. Went into the water to get the leaf and the shark bit me tree times in five seconds and I died. Respawn on raft loosing everything I had on me. No reason to reload, since the game, as mentioned, saves on death.I wanted to like it, but I really dont. It's lackluster and way to rigid. The inventory management made me angry most of the time and the death where I lost everything was the final straw. Done with this.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 10 Mart 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is the potatoes without the meat. Games like this are the main reason why I stay away from Indie games. Raft is a good idea that dies off extremely fast. As a result, the game isn't worth the price of admission. If you can't get this at a discount, put your cash elsewhere. You can finish the game in about 2 hours, and after that, there are boring biomes or creative mode to create a boat to sail to various islands. Building a Raft can be fun; however, that dies off quickly due to the islands being about as dull as Joe Bidens STOU. Combat is something left to be desired. You get a boring spear and bow to fight against bland enemies. The enemies are only 7 in total and uninspiring. It's a complete yawnfest. The last story island was a real disappointment. You have this awesome-looking city and inside of it is a complete and utter borefest waiting for you. It's lifeless, quiet, and dead. What's the point in putting effort into something if all your going to do is get through it and leave? In all, Raft seems rushed, unfinished, and more could have been put into it. If you are thinking about buying this, don't. Save your money and purchase gas instead.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 27 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiEDIT: Nice to find out the death is an auto loss of everything you have on your person. Kind of hard to not die when the enemy cannot be dodged. It's also a good way to hard lock a player. Spending hours to build up and use equipment just to have it lost because something cannot be avoided is not something in a game. This is something for hardcore, not normal. Apparently easy mode keeps your inventory, but the other two is items destroyed on death. Devs need to alter this because that's a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ right there. Hours spent in a game to build up and lose it all? There is no excuse for even a semblance of a recover system to be in place. Especially when it already does with killing an animal. Fix this.I found RAFT very fun and worthwhile. They provide almost everything you need and the research system is probably one of the better I have seen. My only problem is a lack of in game details. I believe something of a tutorial from the main menu and perhaps something in the journal that explains where certain items come from might be useful. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get certain items and the wiki was essential. Over all, love the game, i would suggest it for sure.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 23 Haziran 2020Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiI love the concept behind the game and some of the ideas but I hate the camera movements and jerkiness of the screen the entire game. I get motion sickness and ironically got it trying to play this raft game. I turned on the motion sickness option but still couldn't tolerate it.

"Yayınlanma: 17 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is incredibly unfishished. It's got a lot of potential, but, frankly, there's a whole lot of stupid stuff that really ruin it for me. The most notable is how painfully long it takes to load the world, every single time you start up. Oh, and how it's automatically always sitting on the 'everyone can join' function, as though I actually want to play with anyone else.Beyond that, there's barely anything to do, once you finally get to islands. Eventually, you track down signals and such, but, it becomes quickly apparent you aren't actually getting anything interesting out of it. You get a few blueprints that barely change your ship, with the same resources you already had by and large.It feels like a waste of time, after a bit.Something only expanded on by the horrible death system. You lose everything when you die, regardless of where you die. It literally disappears. Not just falls into the sea or some such, where you have to collect it. I'm talking you're on your raft, you die, you literally respawn right next to where you died, and your stuff has magically gone into the aether.It's not a good system.It only makes the whole thing feel even more pointless. Especially when you die because you were in another tab waiting for the game to finally start often taking several minutes only for it to spawn you in the ocean, where you instantly get murdered by some pufferfish's poison.The start's okay. It's slow, but, it does feel like you're growing. As soon as you have about ten nets, however, everything goes down the metephorical toilet.Hopefully, they'll fix the end game some at some point. Right now, though, it feels like I'm just grinding for no real gain beyond replacing what I lose whenever the game decides to get janky.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 20 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiif you're looking for a good single player atmospheric ocean survival game i'd recommend you look somewhere else, like subnautica. Much like rust and ARK this game seems to have been designed with multiplayer in mind, otherwise you'll be having a significantly harder time trying to build a stable food/water system, as well as several significant crippling design flaws with single player.First, you can get easily soft-locked if you try and play anything harder than ""easy"" since one of the most critical tools, the hook, runs on durability just to pick up anything not near your raft and without it you are flirting with danger trying to swim with sharks around. Add this to the fact your raft has the durability of a wet slice of bread and requires more materials to repair, your raft can be easily eaten by sharks (who are extremely difficult to kill in early game). You'd think this wouldn't be an issue and you could build another one but no, because the devs designed the entire game around your raft, if it is destroyed or drifts away while you're exploring the game permantly deletes everything in the world making you stuck in a loop of dying of dehydration.I'd been holding off on this game for a while since launch, but I was excited to finally play it with the story mode addition, however it seems like that is supposed to be end-game content",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Mayıs 2018Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiThis has the potential to become a great game, but a lot of stuff is holding it back.- First it has no tutorial so you have no idea on how to play this game. Since many games are called/have a Raft it can be quite hard to find a youtube video or other documentation on how to play- Second the earlygame will get boring quite quickly, throwing a hook at objects is fun the first 15 minutes, but thereafter it begins to become a nusense since it is the main source of material collection.- Third The food and water bars either deplet to quickly or the food/water repleanishes to little, this turnes the game into a babysit the stat-bars and not build your dream raft as i had hoped.- Fourth the research is possibley one of the worst kind of progression you can have in a game. You have to find random blueprints inside of barrels floating around, and hope it is the one you wanted and not some random one you dont care about. And to add insult to injury, it it random whether there is a blueprint in these barrels.- Fifth This game should not be 20€/$, the content in the game is way to little to justify the 20$/€. There exist complete games of similar to this charging only 23€/$, that has way more content. The price of this game should be 8€/$ at its current stateDespite all these negatives, the game has some redeemable qualities.- First of the game has Great Visuals, the games looks great and runs great.- Second, The game is a Great Concept, that needs some tweaking and i sure belive this game will become a great game.If i were you i would wait for a sale to pick it up or try it out to see if you find these things stated above as a problem.Overall:3/10 - With reddemable qualities",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 Kasım 2022An amazing, original game that I can't recommend. The last chapter's descent into jumping puzzles and damage-sponge bosses ruins it. Play this game if you want to experience the fun of building a raft, but know that it ends badly and awkwardly.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 Kasım 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiIf you don't like platform games, don't invest money or time in this game.Game advancement ultimately depends entirely on your ability to use the mouse and keyboard to run, jump, and navigate over a set of obstacles that are non-trivial for those of us who hate platformers.If I wanted a platformer, I would have bought one.  I HATE, HATE, HATE them, so I avoid them as much as possible.  I would never knowingly buy one or waste disk space on one.  I hate having to use my mouse and keyboard for precisely timed movements.But if you want to get beyond the Chapter 1 in this game, you must be proficient for at least one such situation.  I could find no other way. You have to reach the top level of the Radio Tower to move on to Chapter 2.  For me that is extremely difficult, at best, and I have been unable to complete this step after many attempts.Attempting to navigate across a beam and jump onto some stairs, then jump across another wide area is not my idea of fun, I realized that I was unable to complete this jump successfully, it is beyond my meager abilities.  So it doesn't matter what great content they put beyond that point, I will never be able to experience it.  For me this was a complete waste of time!  I'm stuck at level 1.I admit I'm terrible at platformers, which is why I don't like or purchase games that require it.So, for me, after hours of fun, interesting game play, I ran into a game advancement requirement that is completely foreign to the theme of the game.  This game, despite its great start and good intentions, left me extremely frustrated and quickly moved from something worth playing to something I could no longer stand to play.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 Ekim 2022Raft is game of patience, solitude and collecting garbage in the oceanOne might as well find this game in the midst of all that garbage.Unfortunately it is not a hidden gem, more like an interestingly looking dirty rag besides another dirty rag.To sum it up:Everything has durabillity but you are not able to repair anything. Thus making improved tools is not worth it and just unsatisfying and unrewarding. No quality of life features, which increases the grind to an mindnumbing level.Once you are able to cook stuff in the cooking pot you think nice, now I only need a clay bowl.However your character has titanium teeth and stomach acid with an ph value of -2 because he consumes the clay bowl too, so have fun digging up clay again.The islands are best described as a waste of space between the trash in the ocean containing a handfull of animals that dont drop usefull resources if any at all. A weird bird that drops 50lbs stones on your head ?And more trash in the reef at the shore side of the island that then drops of at a nearly 90° angle into the void.Oh boy, the buildung system. I am only able to express myself with disappointed sounds. This seems like it was done without any love for creation. Inconsistent at best, where you are able to build something on one side, but not the other side of a symetrical structure.Try putting a cooking recipy onto a wooden pillar, it will just be stuck inside the pillar with the paper sticking out left and right..... that describes it best.The shark is also not a threat at all for it being the seemingly main feature that accompanies your through the game. The movement is strange, where it rushes through the ground, islands, or anything else in its path.You poke it a couple of times with your wooden stick, then its dead and 2 min later its back again.It looks nice though.",N/A

I find the Shark damaging your raft mechanic to be a strange choice why not just have the storms and high waves do it?2.) All resource collecting at the start being tied to an RNG stream of items makes collecting them such a frustration.3.) Some of the control are odd (Ex. why when using your water container on the purifier do you use E instead of just LMB).4.)

"Yayınlanma: 28 Mart 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe core gameplay from my first 6 hours in, is pure frustration. All you do in this game is hook floating items and attempt to manage your fast depleting hunger and thirst. Literally couldn't find enough materials to get to the first chapter, you're constantly low on materials because you have to hook EACH individual piece of wood. The shark responds within a minute of killing it, so you there's NO freedom to explore anything outside your raft.The final straw was trying to build the first radio, and trying to get copper/iron and all the materials needed to build all the components. Apparently you need to build the radio one level up for better signal, fine, so I did that. However, I misplaced a pole, and tried fixing it. Turns out it was the last pole holding up the wooden plank. After breaking that pole, the entire second floor collapsed and I lost ALL of the tools on the second floor, including all the workshops that we've spent hours trying to make.I'm coming from Valheim, a game where there's a sense of adventure and progression.

"Yayınlanma: 9 Mart 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI think the concept of the game is fantastic. It does look good, and I have seen a lot of Ytubers enjoy this game, which is why I bought it.What really lets this game down is the UI, I know I need rope, but under which heading is it. If I have the basic item in my inventory use that, stop the step by step. I now need to make a cup, where is that, now a water filter then a fishing rod and now a grill, and if the shark attacks I need to switch to my spear which hopefully I found under that menu option. Oh wait I can't use my spear because the UI is open.It needs a Heading of essential to survival, rope cup, spear, water filer, (actually the water filter should come with a cup) etc.Oh and let's talk about the grind. You reach a point where getting the garbage out of the ocean becomes so boring., and not getting what you need.Build this well if I have the stuff to I would. See above. Whilst I am fishing, eating and drink, I am missing out on so much precious loot in the form of barrels or I am going through a rich zone of garbage, but can't collect it because i am starving, then depending on level you are playing at, the shark starts eating your raft, you cannot repair it, because you were eating etc.Will I continue to play the game.

Yayınlanma: 23 Eylül 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiMy friend recommended this to me and I thought it sounded like a fun and cute game. I really wanted to like it and I gave it multiple goes. However the clunky mechanics left me falling off regularly and struggling to pick up items that I had lined myself up for. The shark attacks on your raft and bird attacks on your crops became frustrating fast. The part of this game that made me uninstall it and give up on it was the jerkiness of the 1st person viewpoint.

But, there's a shark that's ALWAYS there about 20 feet of your boat. Ready to attack as soon as you're in the water. there's also a nice building aspect to the game, you can custom your raft as you please. expand it, build machines, gardens, etc. But I got bored pretty quick of harvesting the same 5-ish skins of trashes that float pass my boat using some sort of hook that is sketchy to use.  I didn't stick too long with this game. i wish I would have waited for the full game. but, i'm not even sure there'll be a full game after a full year in early access",N/A

Yayınlanma: 14 Kasım 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI played the game from the start.

"Yayınlanma: 24 Mayıs 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft is a very, VERY, slow paced game, almost to a fault. As stated in the title you build a raft, and work to survive on a large ocean. This game can be described in one simple word:Boring.Not only is the gameplay entirely too slow, but graphics arn't all there either. If this game looked nearly as good as something like subnautica i'd probably brush aside the rough gameplay. Raft also tows the line on what an ""Early access"" game is. Released almost 4 years ago, and having made tons of money, Raft is still an early access game, and IT SHOWS. You'd think after all that time and money the game would be... well... fun.Theres better games out there than Raft. Maybe check back when its fully released. 2/10",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 12 Mart 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiSo I really love survival crafting games. But this one... I just can't get as into. Your items break so fast.... Land is obnoxious to get to, and just constantly fishing for more stuff and burning through things you've collected, on top of having to monitor food and water, and dealing with an obnoxious shark that feels basically like a time limit that judges how long you have until your raft shrinks more. You can't really relax ever, I just feel stressed the when time. Kills the fun for me when there are others out there that at least give you a breather here and there, and don't force you to repeatedly do the same things over and over and over again. Love the setting, it's graphically pretty good, and controls are fine. I just can't get behind the redundancy this games makes you deal with though.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game reminds me of No Man's Sky in a way... There is no actual point, no real story or depth to this game...

"Yayınlanma: 6 Mart 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI literally hate even putting this as not recommended but this game is just in a very weird place. Without mods I would not touch this game for example.Pro's-Its a pretty chill experience (with mods) The building is not bad and it does a good job of making you feel isolated and alone. You choose your own pace to play this for the most part and can journey past the prologue at your own speed and build your raft to fit your needs.Con's-Survival mechanics in this game are about as bad as it gets. Mods are the only way to truly enjoy this game. Your food and water go down so quickly you will spend 90% of your time trying to feed yourself 8 meals in a day. Even neebs gaming is turned off by the stupid survival mechanics. Devs obviously did not listen as this has been brought up time and time again. Bad devs = why this game is basically a flop for sales and only has a cult following.-The shark is annoying and way to clingy to the raft and if you go into the water. This would not be an issue if it did not take 12 hits with a metal spear to kill it. As it is now you speed way to much time fishing for shark bait or you spend 15 minutes timing your attacks to kill the shark to get about 2 real world minutes until it spawns again. Its absolutely stupid and shows these devs really do not understand or play their own game.-Seagulls constantly attack your crops or scarecrow. The screecher can kill you easily dropping rocks on your head if you are not good at timing when to sprint and it drops seagull loot so most players sprint away rushing over islands. You can tell very little thought went into this games creatures. Mods can fix this but most mods make everything passive which makes the game boring.-Dev team cannot even get their floating mechanics correct with waves. Your float floor is underwater whenever their are waves.-This game updates are so slow it teethers on abandoned almost. They post update blogs showing pictures of cats , typical indie foreign dev team.Overall for the price you can probably get some decent hours out of the game but without mods this game is a balance train wreck and the devs are slow updating their game and do not address the long standing issues. Also why do all islands have beaches if the world is supposed to be covered with water? Also why is there ZERO fish life but a pufferfish and shark in the water? Overall just an amateur game that little effort seems to be going into.",N/A

We only got 630ish away before ending up getting pulled back to the first part of the story. Game = Broken... Would be better if we could port our raft to another part of the game (i.e. starting with our raft we spent hours on instead of the initial 1 block. This was just from today's gameplay. The other times I had a creative profile crash the game, not able to be used again. The issue was solved after uninstalling the game and reinstalling and waiting for an update to be completed, but my friend and I lost all of our progress.

Your reward is shark steak and another shark in a few minutes.If you want to explore an island or underwater, kill the shark and you still might come back to your boat to find the new shark ate your anchor, birds destroyed your scarecrow, and the watermelon you grew didn't give you any seeds.

But this kind of nagging, exaggerated sustenance mechanic is an absolute trudge, and I'm pretty sure a day in Ocarina of Time (about 5 minutes) lasts longer than these food and water bars.Then there's the shark in the room. The RCE vulnerability. They implied they patched it, but they effectively threw a wooden board over a huge pothole and called it fixed. It took a known security firm pointing it out to draw attention to it to get them to even make the half-baked attempt.The annoying ""tapeworm-having-esque"" food and water drain was already a massive no, but the security flaw seals it.

In Starve together (single player mode) and in City Skylines, you can pause those games at any moment to take care of other things in life: family interaction, deliveries, trying to eat while playing etc.Raft simply does not have a pause button, so you end up Saving a game, Exiting the a game to the main menu and then Load the game, which takes too much time for someone like me to handle.. A problem that could have been solved with a simple Pause button..I am sure that Raft is a good game, there is a lot of positive reviews to the game from players who dedicate their full attention to the game; however I bought this game years ago, and I cannot bring myself to play the game because of the no pause button..

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ağustos 2022Normally, I don’t write reviews, but I feel like this game is one in particular that deserves one.The best way I can describe this game, is that it’s an unpolished ball of dirt. In that it’s surprising how someone could make something like this, but it needs to be polished, and maybe given a coat of paint.Gameplay wise, I did enjoy the game for the most part, as the story requires you to figure it out yourself. There are no hints, there are no map markers, no one outright says “go here to do this thing!”. Everything must be figured out on your own. Which is refreshing, but also pretty time consuming most of the time.For resource management, equipment, and player abilities, this part definitely could’ve ♥♥♥♥♥♥ some work too. Too many items require too many things. It’s just a relief islands and areas regenerate if you move outside their render distance.The “sprinting” if you could call it that is way too slow for a game of this size. The sprinting speed should definitely be the standard walking speed for the player.Moving onto the enemies, this part definitely could’ve used some work too. The shark is a pain in the ass to deal with, and respawns too frequently. There should atleast be some late-game item that permanently, or semi-permanently, gets rid of it. Like perhaps a rudementary energy shield (suppose it could be incorporated considering everything else in the game).Screechers, boars, and bears are also a pain, with screechers being the biggest pain out of all of them. No one wants to deal with boulders suddenly dropped on their heads.Finally, we move onto multiplayer, and HERE is where the unpolished part really becomes important.This game should NOT be multiplayer. Minor lag causes fights with enemies like the shark to be nigh impossible due to the near-perfect reaction time you need to fight it. Players also have no way of letting other players know where they are without using chat if they do much as walking 20 feet away, as their nametag and character itself becomes extremely hard to spot.In short, it’s a good game that is somewhat fun, but far from polished and somewhat clunky at times. Do not recommend.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Temmuz 2022The game is very polished and runs well but the progression is entirely too slow for my taste and the constant shark becomes very gimmiky and gets boring/annoying fast. The world starts to feel very small once you realize that each island, while slightly different, doesn't offer much new entertainment except for the occasional new spot. Overall I believe there are much better games out there in this survival category.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 202250 hours on record, 20 of which came from the newest update from start to finish, of those 20, 8 of them were me and my buddy floating around grabbing resources to make the raft look good till my other buddy got on so we didn't progress without him. Game is awesome but way too short. Not only is it short, you get great QOL upgrades on the final 2 islands of the story line which was extremely disappointing. Like we beat the game, then you give us the option to use an advanced anchor to tie into our engine controls? There is little to actually nothing to do once the story is over so im not sure what their plan was with giving us those things at the VERY END. and about the end, it was pretty disappointing overall as well. not to spoil anything but not was i was hoping for. if you really wanted to just blast through the story line it could be done in as little as 4 hours. maybe less. which makes all of the upgrades you did for the raft through out feel really unrewarding and unnecessary. Side missions, story line choice making and necessity of the advanced upgrades would have made this a for sure buy. But its replay ability lacks majorly.

"Yayınlanma: 2 Temmuz 2022Wish I could refund this.  Just when I had some mechanics figured out and working (dying several times in the process... ok, sure, it's a survival game), my raft got stuck on murder island where everything tries to murder you, and you lose most of whatever resources you managed to collect every time something murders you.  I don't think that playthrough is salvageable at this point.If that sounds like fun, then maybe it's a game for you.  I came to it from Steam recommendations on Subnautica, and this game is very different.  From the start it's a grueling survival experience, rather than a chill one that builds to exploration, greater and greater risk taking, and developing story.  Raft's not for me, I guess.",N/A

We had a pen full of animals and half of them just suddenly vanished. This isn't the first time it has happened. Reloading a past save doesn't fix any of it either.

"Yayınlanma: 21 Nisan 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiЭта игра - какая-то шутка.В игре,которая основана на путешествиях на плоту - совершенно не реализована механика паруса.На одном маленьком парусе что плот в 10 блоков,что в 1000 плывет одинаково.Более того,ставить более одного паруса бессмысленно.Скорости это не даёт.Браво.Даже в Донт старве,игре,в которой плот явно не на первом плане - механика паруса реализирована лучше.Больше парусов - больше скорости.Один мотор может вытянуть до 100 блоков.При чем эти блоки - только пол.Мотору всё равно,если я построю 99 полов и целую крепость на них.Он вытянет,игнорируя какой либо вес других построек.Бред.Дальность прорисовки,а особенно бинокль - какой-то троллинг.В ИГРЕ ПЕРСОНАЖ КАКОГО ТО ЧЁРТА ВИДИТ ДАЛЬШЕ И ЛУЧШЕ ПЕРИФЕРИЙНЫМ ЗРЕНИЕМ.Прямо перед вами остров.Но вы его не видите.Не хватает дальности прорисовки.Поворачиваетесь боком - видите.Ну,думаешь,сделаю бинокль,буду высматривать острова БИНОКЛЕМ.Делаешь его - А ОН ВООБЩЕ НИЧЕГО НЕ ДАЕТ.Ну то есть дальности прорисовки вообще никакой.Зачем нужен бинокль?Зачем нужен пластик и пальмовые листы?Кроме начала конечно же.Построив основание плота,для которого нужен пластик,пластик становится практически бесполезен и тратить его в больших кол-вах некуда.Тоже самое и с пальмовыми листами.Их особенно много.Что пластика,что листов я уже викинул наверное тысячи.Так же бесполезны и гнезда чаек с их перьями.Стрелы лутаются с трупов.Если хотя бы иногда засаживать огород под открытым небом - уже с избытком этих перьев.А гнезда дают перья..Смысл этих гнезд только в том,чтобы убивать самому чаек туда прилетающих для мяса.Оптимизация мусор.Говорить больше нечего.Игра откровенно сырая и очень простая.В ней делать нечего.Почему в этой игре почти за 2 года так отвратно реализована механика парусов и почему еще нет какого-нибудь топ-паруса за 100-500 канатов мне тоже не понятно.И не понятно,почему нет большого применения пластику,листам и перьям уже с середины игры-лэйта.При учете конечно же что ловушки уже построил.Если так посмотреть - смогу рекомендовать игру не раньше апдейта двадцатого.А пока что игра сыра,неоптимизированна и непродуманна.Спустя более полугода перепрошел игру.Когда игру уже знаешь она проходится еще быстрее и становится еще больше очевидно насколько в игре мало контента.Игра проходится за день,максимум два.Продуктивность создателя - глава раз в год.Реального времени эта глава займет максимум час-два игры.На данный момент вышел реновейшн апдейт.Можно пожалуйста сделать глубины в геймплее и игровых механиках,а не в декорациях?Ну,видимо нет.Как и сказал,видимо игра станет играбельной не раньше 20 апдейта,а судя по активности разработчиков это не раньше чем лет через 5.КОНТЕНТА НЕТ,ДЕЛАТЬ НЕЧЕГО.",N/A

I'd then stand on top of the raft, trying to store my things in the box - and then instantly die due to a bird i think? Something. Either the shark clipped through the raft to kill me or a bird killed me somehow. I'd just randomly die. I now have to restart just to do something. Because there was nothing i could have done.

"Yayınlanma: 12 Ocak 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe main content of this game is eating and drinking, there's no interesting content to speak of and to make up for it the developers padded this game by forcing you to eat and drink every 10 minutes, every tool degrades after 5 minutes of use and your raft is torn apart every 5 minutes by a shark that follows you everywhere.There's no real progression, you make your raft bigger, you make tools that degrade after 10 minutes instead of 5, you build up enough food and water storage so you don't have to be fishing and cooking every second and you can fight off the shark a little faster.There's nothing cool to explore outside of story locations, the combat system is just mash mouse 1, base building is a mediocre as it gets, except your base floats, the whole gameplay loop is as follows:Fish>Cook>eat -every 5 minutesPurify water>Drink -every 5 minutesStab shark when he bites your boat-every 5 minutesThrow hook at resources whenever you're not doing any of the aboveCrash into an island and pick up rocks and flowersResearch and craft items that make you not die for a few minutes longer or to make your raft look prettyBuild radio antenna and travel to the set piece to get the coordinates to go the next set pieceRepeat.It's a tedious slog that feels like a time-gated mobile game, there's way better survival games out there with much more interesting things to do.",N/A

Hopped on the game and just was kinda disappointed by the lack of content that this game has. THE ENTIRE GAME is based upon being stuck in the MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN..............Idk why the devs just didn't let the creativity flow and add tons of marine life and cool stuff underwater. (By cool stuff underwater I don't mean the occasional sunken ship with just a crate in it.) They should have at least some different types of fish in the game or something every time you go underwater all you see is the same shark that never stops following your raft. The game gets old fast and you will soon find yourself bored floating with the current probably looking at your other monitor. EVEN WHEN I went to the story islands it was incredibly boring and underwhelming I didn't even want to explore. The story kinda sucks its written out on papers and notes for players to find on the unique islands. Like who wants to read an entire story? I bought a game not a book. Either way I feel like it could have been better and the game has been out for 3 years and I experienced the same gameplay I watched on youtube 3 years ago, So I'm not sure updates are gonna save this one.",N/A

Fish for materials with your hook, which is veeeerrrry slow, and pray that you find an island for a small boost of materials.Even with the lowest level hook you can gather every single material in range easily, finding yourself standing around with nothing to do until more materials get closer.I also played this game in multiplayer, which made the whole game less painful.

On choosing Creative Mode, I found there was STILL no way for me to get used to the controller scheme.  Indeed, I couldn't even find the means to take stock of my situation.This game is possibly as good as its reputation, but it is unplayable unless you use a mouse and keyboard and don't mind having ZERO chance of figuring out what all those buttons do outside of the Binding Options page.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Ağustos 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt's a 4 out of 10 at best.  One word:  BORING.The entire game is eating and cooking.  Don't be fooled - you WILL spend 90 percent of your time managing your food and water intake.  At 16 hours into the game, there has been zero depth to the story or actual game play.  Just eating and drinking.  My friend and I built the transmitter, made it to the ship, islands, collected notes, dropped bridges and did all the puzzles.  Your entire experience is ruined by the fact that you can only go exploring for about 2 minutes before your character is starving or thirsty.  I guess while you're not trying to manage your food and water intake, you might work on crafting a nice looking raft.I guess there's an update coming out in October 2021 that may make the game worth playing.  Otherwise, I recommend playing the Sims.  You will get all the same building options without the hassle of boiling water so your vision doesn't blur between the time you go from one end of the raft to the other.Remember, I had the privilege of playing this with a friend.  I can't imagine how bad my experience would have been playing solo.  I've played a decent amount of survival type games, but this one is just flat out BORING.",N/A

You should be able to camp an island for resources and still get drift wood and plastic.--------------------------The good:Multiplayer works well.Story is interesting.Gameplay is unique in some aspects.Creative move:Awful. You just get infinite resources. No flying, teleporting or ways of exploring the game.

Up until this point I didn't need it at all, so I thought it was an optional weapon for a certain play style.

"Yayınlanma: 8 Haziran 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiGame is fun with friends, played about 30 hours so far and have quite a few quips about my experiences:Gameplay is fairly straight forward, gather this material, research that, craft weapons and explore next island. From experience you tend to run out of metal and wood often and there's not much you can do about it except raid the large islands or drift through the ocean with nets to collect planks. (which is kinda boring.)Now to the least enjoyable parts of this game, inventory wipe on death. It's incredibly punishing and can soft lock your entire game if you didn't stock pile weapons and materials. There is a modloader for this game that has a mod that keeps your inventory through death which is super useful and makes the game a lot more enjoyable. It's called raft mod loader and I recommend you check it out.Another thing I hate about this game is the Skreecher death bug, it's happened to me quite a few times now, and basically it happens when the big rock dropping bird is killed and continues flying and attacking you even though it's a corpse. I tried reinstalling the game and doing a whole bunch of stuff to fix it but nothing really made it 100% go away and it still happened once in a while.All in all it's a grindy game that punishes you for not overpreparing and hoarding items and in general is just a a huge pain the bum if you want to play it by yourself. Story is 10/10 though so there's something good about it after all.TBH I really didn't have too much fun over the 27 hours I played but if you like grindy survival games like The Forest then you might enjoy this buggy mess.Cheers.",N/A

I was early in my playthrough and hadnt even built storage yet and now I am stuck on this island with an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shark killing me when I attempt to go get anything to craft a way to get myself off the island. So now, I have to restart, all because you won't give your players a way to unstuckGive players a !stuck or /stuck command and I will change my review instantly, because this is a good game. This system you have in place however is dumb.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Ağustos 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI spent an hour trying to figure this out and honestly, this game did not exceed my expectations. I restarted this game how many times only for it to bug out countless of times. I have good connection, I changed the settings to make this game work and this game does the same thing over and over again. Honestly would love to enjoy this game if it didn't glitch out so much to the point that my raft was nowhere to be seen even. My friend and I tried to play this and was told that I was on the raft when I wasn't on my screen. Instead of being on the raft, I was down further into the ocean. This game is a waste of $20.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 21 Haziran 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiNot great.I've pretty much researched all of the items available in the game, and while I haven't uncovered the 'mega island', I feel like it would be a very pointless endeavour at this point.The game is actually fun at the beginning: building out your raft and exploring, diving down to get more metal, etc. Sadly, the game quickly reveals itself to be a shallow (pun intended) rinse-and-repeat process that leaves you wanting more while keeping your hunger/thirst/shark at bay... this is all marred by the fact that you know there is nothing else left to research or really 'do', leaving you feeling truly stranded.Despite the price, I'd still pass up on the game - no replay value and ultimately left me feeling empty.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 Şubat 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe price of this game is not worth buying it. Let's look at some of the features shall we?:""Multiplayer! Survive by yourself or with friends in online co-op!"" This is good and all, but there is one thing that is a problem which I will come back to when we get to that feature.""Hook! Use your hook to catch debris floating by.""  Sounds good and all, but A), the hook, metal hook, and the rest of the tools in this game break so damn fast it's almost pointless to upgrade and B) Nobody wants to spend all dang night throwing hooks off your boat to capture debris. This gets very old very quick.""Craft! Build survival equipment, weapons, crop plots and more to help you stay alive!""  Yea and be prepared to have crap loads of plastic and nothing of everything else. Your tools break to dang fast, your hunger goes quick even on easy as well as your thirst, crafting metal tools and weapons such as spear and arrows are too expensive for the lack of damage they do.""Build! Expand your raft from a simple wreckage to a buoyant mansion."" Oh here's a good one. Remember when i said about I get back to the multiplayer feature? Well rather if you are by yourself or with friends, The bigger the raft, the more fps loss you get. Now I don't have the best graphics card in the world, but a gforce gtx 1050TI should handle this with no problems. Funny thing is on their website, one of the common issues posted herehttps://support.redbeetinteractive.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007540171-My-game-is-lagging-is fps loss due to big raft projects. Now I'm no rocket scientist, but a mansion is pretty dang big. That boat in the picture is too, yet you tell me after 7 months you haven't figured out how to fix the frame rate loss issue? My boat is less then half that size and i still have fps loss rather if I'm by myself or with 2 friends I play with.""Research! Learn new things to craft in the research table.""  Yea, you will be done with this table by the time you hit your first or second small island. Then what? Well it's useless that's what. It pretty much becomes a prop or a paper weight.""Navigate! Sail your raft towards new places!"" Yes Yes! Except you can't turn the damn thing. There is no rudder/turning wheel mechanic. What do they say to this?https://support.redbeetinteractive.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007305932-How-do-I-turn-my-raft-...ill save you some time. Again 7 months ago, it was said to use an island to turn your boat. 20 U.S. bucks guys.""Dive! Drop anchor and explore the depths for more resources."" Only on islands can you do this, plus the shark is a constant cancer. You end up spending a ton of resources on flippers and an oxygen bottle that's garbage and breaks really fast as well as metal spear or maybe bow and arrows which in the end you spend more then you gain. Sure you kill the shark good for you! Just wait 2 mins and he'll be back to yet again bite your butt. Let's not forget the shark only drops 4 shark meat and his head every time. For 20 usd they could of thought to give the shark a loot table of other things, or even more then just 4 shark meat. The way your hunger goes down in this game, it's pretty much worthless. Again, you pretty much spend more killing the shark and farming resources then you actually gain in the end.""Fight! Defend your raft from the dangers of the ocean."" You fight 1 f'n shark that respawns ever 2 mins on an non turn-able raft using a hook that breaks collecting debris to build up your boat to fps loss conditions. Hey! I just basically summed up this game! Maybe I should of written this at the start!",N/A

It's unexpected, but most certainly a very, very pointless end to a big buildup.

"Yayınlanma: 5 Şubat 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft is like an oyster with no pearl inside; all shell with no substance. If you want to experience everything this game has to offer, save the cash and just watch the trailer.It's a fair attempt at the survival/crafting genre, but lacked the substance needed to keep me coming back. I love the concept, even if it's not unique, but it lacks so much attention to detail that you see in another comparable games. The lack of environmental hazards really killed the immersion for me, at no point in this game did I ever feel like I was actually at the mercy of the environment. It requires no tactical building, relying instead on a mind-numbing resource grind that becomes horribly repetitive after just a few hours.There are only 3 primary hazards in this game: starvation, dehydration, and a single giant shark that perma-trolls your ship. Every few minutes he'll chomp a square of your ship.  If you spear him enough, he'll let go. If not, he'll destroy the square and anything built on it. You can kill the shark, but 5 minutes later a new one will spawn that will troll you until you kill him too. Rinse and repeat. It runs like clockwork. There are no other hostile creatures to worry about, no heat stroke or sunburn to worry about, no exhaustion to worry about, and (sadly) no storms to worry about. Well, storms are present, but they are purely aesthetic. That's right, the most deadly threat on the open ocean has been reduced to the danger level of a theme park ride.I'll try Raft again at some point in the future to see if the devs decided to add some real substance, but until then I just can't recommend paying money for it, there are other comparable titles out there that will give you more bang for your buck.",N/A

I've been watching it since it went Early access and Steam Summer sale seemed like the right time. I am very disappointed that it's flagging this way with my security protocols. Please fix this, I was testing it out for myself and my nephews(we wanted this game to co-op together).I reserve the right to change my opinion and recommendation for this game, based on If this issue is corrected.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThere is a difference between a challenging game and an unfair one. This one is the latter.Playing on ""normal"" difficulty, the game places you right from the get-go in a situation that goes from difficult to impossible. Namely, when a shark chewed up your raft, it's impossible to recover because you'll not be able to collect enough resources to build a new one before you die. You can't even craft a hammer. Once you respawn, you have about 5-10 seconds in which you're alive until the next shark bite kills you.Found an island and are safe from sharks? Lucky you! Except for some reason the island just ""disappears"" after about a minute or so and you fall through it into a complete void (ocean, no salvage, well at least no sharks either).I can also place a water purifier on my tiny crappy raft, but not on said island? Who made up these stupid rules?At least this way, while trying to suffocate myself to commit suicide I got the ""Exploring the Depths!"" steam achievement.Honestly, no fun.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 18 Aralık 2022Update: The game is safe to play online for now. They updated the security stuff after all. They are still terrible people, so don't support this title.TL;DR, Redbeet put out a game with a security flaw. Multiplayer is completely unsafe, even if you know for sure that the people you are playing with are not hacked.This studio has been a sham since the beginning. It feels like the worst possible people struck gold with such an engaging gameplay loop, but the disrespect of their community, their deliberate radio silence on the security issue, and their utter lack of understanding in all the bugs and exploits that are left in a 1.0 release are proof that they never wanted to be game developers at all. Perhaps they should have left Raft to die on itch.io, instead of pursuing money over passion. They were made aware of the security issue with outdated bootstrapped protocols in JUNE 2021. They decided not to update them or fix anything because they have never deleted a line of code or fixed a bug on purpose.Super frustrating to see indie devs with absolutely no integrity.",N/A

The story is just a reason to go to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ island that is drawn out and uninteresting once you land. Resources just disappear too fast and you just wait to pick up stuff on the sea. Your tools become the best version possible after a couple of islands, so there is no progression or anything to actually build towards.Just a boring, overhyped game that doesn't change and gets boring fast. Don't recommend, even with a co op partner like I had.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Nisan 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI really wish I could give this game a positive review, but I just can't. It has all the trappings of what COULD have been a great game, but there are so many minor (and a couple major) flaws that it brings the whole experience down.There are some really great things this game does, the base combat itself is really good, and generally, melee combat feels not just viable, but what you should do, though this admittedly does come at the cost of effectively turning all guns into headshot-only sorts of things. Especially once you get down the skill tree, most of the perks/abilities you unlock, I find, are actually useful and aren't just EXP drain fluff, aside from maybe the shield ability? The day/night cycle is super cool, and while games have done the ""nighttime ♥♥♥♥ gets harder"" shtick before, I dunno, I just like the feeling of Dying Light's take on it. The nighttime is genuinely harder, in nearly all manners. Your visibility, provided you don't up the gamma to cheat into having night vision, is heavily limited, as the game emulates darkness pretty well, and unless you have a good supply of night vision meds which were (for me) incredibly limited, all you have is a flashlight that gets weaker over time, meanwhile, superpowered zombies show up that hit harder, run faster, and chase longer, all the while, you have to blindly parkour your way to your goal.However, that's largely about all of the good.The nighttime mechanics has its flaws, chiefly in that, its basically completely avoidable in most circumstances, and the only reason to do it is for either one of like three or four quests that require it, or for the double XP gain. However, the vast majority of quests are either doable at any time of day, and the ones that are night-only tend to be pretty easy quests that just devolve into ""go to place with very few zombies and pick flowers at night"", or they're story missions where time just warps to whatever the current mood needs, and weirdly enough, those superpowered zombies just don't show up half the time during nighttime segments in the story missions.As for the parkour, Crane (the main character) seems to grab further than he should be able to, and other times, he can't grab onto something that should absolutely be grab-able, leading to unfair deaths. A perk that lets you jump off walls somehow makes this even worse, and I find myself dying because Crane decided that, instead of grabbing onto an awning or ledge, he just wall jumps off the wall instead, plummeting to his doom. Another perk unlocks a grappling hook, which has huge utility and is an amazing reward for grinding to the level needed for it, but at times when it would be most useful, especially major story quests that often feature huge hordes, and at points, hordes that are actively chasing you while you parkour, or you simply have to scale awkward environments, the game simply locks you out of using a tool that would be a huge help.The game fails to explain how enemies are scaled. Instinctively, you might think enemies are scaled to your Survivor Level, the game's version of a sort of overall level, but actually, the weapons you can find and buy are tied to your Survivor Level, while enemies are scaled to how far you are in the main story questline. This means if you decide to do a couple story missions in a row, especially in Hard mode, you can suddenly find yourself facing enemies with health pools FAR above what you can output in damage, and likewise, if you decide to hit every single side quest, challenge, and grind (seemingly) infinite random encounters, before you hit the next main quest, you will find yourself in situations where even boss enemies only take four or five hits to beat.Speaking of difficulty, the game does not explain that Hard mode is not meant for a first-time playthrough, given that your character's progression carries over between playthroughs, it seems that you are actually meant to do a playthrough in Normal (unless you enjoy a good round of video game CBT), then go onto Hard or higher. So, if you finish a playthrough as Level 12, and start the next playthrough, you will begin as Level 12 with all the perks and skills, and I believe inventory, unless you delete your character (If that's possible.) I'm not interested in doing a second full playthrough, so I'm unsure as to how or even if this is balanced at all.The map design is pretty good, but I find that you spend way too much time in the Slums, and way too little time in the Old Town part of the map. My biggest complaint in regards to map design is that in a game that has you parkouring and freerunning everywhere, in every story quest, and most side quest areas, the routes you have to take are incredibly linear. While you might climb or jump around to get to your objective, there is almost always just one correct, non-glitch way to get to your goal, especially before you unlock the grapplehook (which as I said earlier, is often locked for story quests). In essence, a quest might have you get to the top of a radio tower, but there is often only one specific, pre-planned route to actually get up to the top without the grapple hook.Another issue is the writing, my God is the writing atrocious at times. The premise itself is fine, it's very Dead Island-y, its a semi-isolated area that suddenly has a huge zombie outbreak for mysterious reasons, you are The Really Awesome Dude, who gets ♥♥♥♥ done, even the most mundane of things, like picking flowers for random-♥♥♥♥♥♥-69, while your radio has some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ screaming about how their whole base is going to fall apart soon enough. The major questline was largely uninteresting beyond its setpieces, which actually are at times very nice. However, my biggest issue with the writing is Crane. As a character, he is just incredibly uninteresting and bland, imagine the most bland vaguely-gruff, slighty-bearded, military-looking white dude. He has very little interesting interaction with anyone, and honestly, I wonder if he should have just been a silent protagonist rather than a voiced one. Crane's voice actor, while certainly talented, given his line delivery is great, but as a voice and the lines he has, he just doesn't fit the setting at all. He sounds far too chipper, too excited and happy most of the time. In fact, in the one quest where I genuinely felt bad, which involved killing an elderly man's now-zombified wife as he, effectively, breaks down, Crane just acts like ""Woah, sorry bro, lmao, xDDD"".And the ending. My God, the ending is such a massive letdown. Whoever decided the big climactic showdown should be like five or six quick-time events in a row is just, failed terribly at their job.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 27 ŞubatI was initially really excited and wanted to play when i saw some lets plays, but now i realize my purchase was a mistake. the damages early game are nonsense, gathering is a pain and the shark is literally crippling. hogs are just as bad. thankfully they give you collection nets to allow easier collection, BUT, when you finally get enough resources to make the collectors your boat gets turned around and all those collectors are practically useless.... the same thing happened in a couple of lets plays i saw, so i'm guessing this is programmed into the game to make gathering more difficult. yes, there is a steering wheel...... in late game..... great. some may say, just get more resources, go swimming, explore islands!okay, cool. BUT THERE IS A FREAKING SHARK WAITING TO EAT YOU!!!! and when you finally manage to kill it it doesn't respawn for something like 3-5 minutes...... that is a really short time to actually gather the goods under water. And then there are the boars..... ugh.you cannot move anything!!!!! once you place it the only way to change its position is to completely destroy it BY destroying the floor of your boat...... then you have to rebuild it in the crafting menu then place the new item down. THE OLD ITEM IS LOST!!!! but we have a crafting hammer? and an ax?also, only spears, bows, and machetes do damage, axes are not a weapon.....i get that your trying to make a fun survival experience, but this wasn't it. needs some tweaking to make it even basically payable.My recommendation:1, let the shark just go away sometimes and put a notification message in that says, ""all clear, no sharks about"" when the shark leaves and ""Shark Sighted!!!"" when they come back around to give the player a warning to get back to land or the boat.2, the damages need to be re-scaled. i get it if you just want to play hard mode and Die, cool, do that. tons of people don't. give them the option to actually play without unnecessary pains. as of right now, the wooden spear needs to make 30 hits on the shark to kill it, OK, fine, but make it run away after 5 or 10 and give the all clear signal. or just make the spear do more damage.3, you gave us a hammer, let us use it to move things without having to make new ones.4, redo the crafting a little bit, 5 planks and 3 rope to make a ""WOODEN"" Spear? uh, why? if it is this useless it should only cost 1 wood for it's usability. it doesn't even have anything on the tip so what is the rope for?! the toss anchor is attached to the boat via a rope, why can't i pull it up? you have to destroy it to allow your boat to move again..... again with the wasted resources.researching new equipment is cool, but the gathering of materials makes it a pain. the crafting system is very smooth. i love it, but many of the items have much higher crafting prices then they should for the usability of the items. spears, floors and gathering hooks, being several such thing. cooking is very slow for the reward.you need a paddle, but paddling is so slow that it costs about 3 paddles to do any measure of navigation.you should consider going to Windbound for ideas here. they did the boat and most every feature of it better.all of this was experienced on easy mode, because i didn't want to suffer to enjoy myself. if this is easy mode..... i cannot recommend it",N/A

Until this is fixed or removed it is basically game breaking for me and frustrating enough to warrant giving a negative review.(Update) The only way past that particular part is to glitch past it with a friend.

"Yayınlanma: 15 OcakTHE REVIEWS HERE ARE SO ODD! This game is trash, horrible puzzles, the shark is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying, the platforming is broken, the ending is so bad, the only good boss is a bigger shark that breaks through pillars. The only good thing about this game is the building variety, which is actually really really good. But definitely not worth the money I paid for this",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 OcakI really wanted to like this game. However, after nearly an hour of breaking my raft to try to change the shape, destroying multiple paddles, and the sail being useless, I'm still stuck slamming into the cove of this random island. Whoever decided that the wind should always go only one direction was sure thinking that one through. I was having fun, but a game breaking issue like this is completely awful and ruins any sense of fun I was having. Uninstalled and never coming back, I'm sure there's lots to like here, but what a terrible design decision.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 OcakOverall the game is pretty mid. The story has more holes than it does plot, and many of the puzzle sections are a crime against game design, but the gameplay loop of going to islands, collecting resources and building is quite relaxing, and seeing your raft slowly grow and take shape is quite fun, also the hitboxes for things you can build on your raft are surprisingly precise (you can do things like put a storage box underneath some tables/counters). However, the game is terribly unpolished: the enemy movements are terribly jagged (especially the screecher), animations frequently dont cancel/start correctly and if you for whatever self-hating reason decide to try to solve the puzzles yourself you more often than not figure out how by the game just breaking completely when you dont do everything exactly as expected.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 29 Aralık 2022A bug ridden mess that confuses difficulty with tedium. Are there are people that will enjoy this game? Yes,  but there are so so many survival craft games out there, why settle for this one?",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 31 Aralık 2022I can definitively say that this game appears to be balanced for multiplayer, and doesn't offer much in the way of fun for single player. There are a multitude of deliberate design choices that were made as an effort to balance the game for multiple players.First sign of this is that tools and gear break way too easily. It's absolutely ludicrous how quickly things break, and how often you'll find yourself crafting new tools. But the game developers need the player to keep crafting new tools and equipment because materials are too plentiful. Why are materials too plentiful? Because they designed the game to literally flood the player with materials while they're on islands and adrift at sea. But why flood the player with materials? Because they're supposed to be gathered by multiple people.Inventory space is really scarce, and storage is inadequate. By the time you get larger storage boxes and an increase to the backpack, you're pretty much already at the end-game and used to working with the heavy restriction. Again, a deliberate choice, because you're supposed to be playing the game with multiple people which will offer expanded carrying capacity. I found myself forced to offload after nearly every 1-2 minutes of gathering materials, and eventually got to a point where I'd find myself standing in front of my storage with nothing to actually offload just out of habit.The sharks and the shriekers are absolutely the worst. The bow and arrow might as well be a spitball shooter, and the sharks are just relentless. The only relief you'd get from sharks is to use bait, which requires 4 fish (but not just any 4 fish, 'cus sharks are picky eaters), which requires a fishing rod, which requires materials, and oh yeah that fishing rod is gonna break after you only get enough fish for like 2 baits so have fun making more of those. I found it to be easier to just let the shark take bites out of me, and respawn back in bed to get a new health pool and go again.The food and water system is way out of balance and just baffles me. Players have to eat what is roughly the equivalent of their own body weight in food to get a full meter, and have to likewise drink a swimming pool.. but I never found myself out of either. To the contrary, my food storage bins were overflowing with food. The result was just tediously going back and forth to micromanage something that was never in ANY danger whatsoever of becoming a hazard. The Tier 2 water purifier will make water entirely irrelevant. Food is absolutely everywhere, you can't take ten steps without tripping over it, so to balance this they made all the food have the nutritional content of cardboard. I ate an entire stack of raw potatoes and still had room leftover for 2 massive steaks. No wonder the sharks are always hungry.After unlocking all of the crafting recipes and having a fully developed raft in single player after about 7 hours, I just found myself to be bored. There's a lot of serious mistakes in design choices that just don't make a lot of sense, and aren't fun. Contrast this to something like Minecraft and Terraria, which set the gold standard for survival crafting, where you're allowed to gather resources with large stacks and have a massive inventory space. Raft decided to keep stacks really small (<20), and to heavily restrict your inventory, bombard you with resources, and then make building costs really high. It just creates a relentless back and forth mixed with tedious micro-management of like 12 different tools/equipment pieces that are all at different levels of durability. Raft feels more like the kind of survival crafting game that you might get if you were a worker in an ant colony.Also, apparently I have the expertise to craft a radio, antenna and batteries from raw materials, but I don't know how to use a single plank of wood as a rudder to rotate my raft. I'm a moronic genius.",N/A

You will not survive, no one ever does.Help me. help me. help me. hel-",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 27 Aralık 2022Meh. I've played a lot of survival games, and I love them typically, but this one is honestly quite dull. Most of the time all you're doing is trying to hook things or collect loot while your raft floats along; this gets old really fast. I was playing on normal, and the amount of effort it takes to maintain food and water levels, repair damage, and stop shark attacks, it's really just a constant grind and there isn't much extra time to build cool stuff. Exploring is boring as hell; islands that spawn are pretty much all the same, and the only thing I found interesting was that on occasion I might get something unique out of a crate. Despite this, without guidance in game as to how to read the blueprints, I couldn't be bothered to google it to figure it out; I just don't see this game getting any more interesting.There might be some value to this game if you like grinding, or play on creative or something, but frankly I'm just going to see about getting it refunded and find something better",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 Aralık 2022Considering the game is out of early access it feel as though it is severely lacking compared to other survival games.The UI is poor, you can't split item stacks except by dragging one of each item to a new stack, if you have items in a box and are trying to craft you must move them out of the box. Fairly basic UI helpfullness.The story has no drive to complete it and is lacking any connection for me to want to discover the next step. The shark is essentially pointless as too easy to kill.It could be such a different game but it looks like the Devs lost steam and took the money, ashame really.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 9 Aralık 2022The game has alot of depth, and you can tell the developers tried to make this a complete game, but its not fun. I only played this solo, and you can tell this game is meant to be played simultaneously, in small friend groups. This dynamic doesn't exist aside from streamers in 2022. The game is monotonous and unforgiving. The ""combat"" is so unpolished it might as well not exist. The worst part is inventory management. This game literally gives you items ""blueprints"" which clog your inventory and you should immediately drop. Unless you have a waifu who will play this with you all the time, ignore these good reviews. I regret buying this game and wasting hours of my life.For whatever reason, I still want to finish this game. It just tries so hard to be every type of game, at the same time. It's a puzzle game, a survival game, a platformer, and it has severe flaws in all of them. I'm trying to do this laser puzzle on Temperance, and it is hot flaming garbage. The devs want to make this like Portal and Minecraft combined. I will finish this game but it's a trash title. Save your 20 bucks.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 2 Aralık 2022It's very boring unless you get fun from throwing a hook out and fishing up random objects in the hope of finding a stone.  Don't be thinking crazy thoughts like go to an island and get one.  The only stones on islands are underwater where you get constantly attacked by sharks.  If you're not careful your raft floats off without you so now you are half eaten with no raft and a few wet stones if you're lucky.  Then you lose the will to live and go play something else.,N/A

It doesnt makes sense for a the type of game this is. You can have fun if you are with a friend tho. You only unlock stuff if you make story missions. Nothing you do in the survival setting matters. If you go to the story mission you get blueprints. The worst thing about the progression system is that you get the best stuff after you have beaten the game. But there is nothing to do after you get the best blueprints. It's pointless.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 26 Kasım 2022I'M NOT A FAN OF THIS ONE1.) the controls and the character response need more work.2.) The on-screen menus are very intrusive. (the main reason the shark would kill me while trying to craft a tool or any other item)3.) Way too easy to get disoriented. The raft moves like it has a motor on it when you fall off and once you figure out where it is, it's like a mile away in the opposite direction.I did watch a few YouTube videos and I was sorely mistaken at the ease of how players fished debris and killed the shark.I decided to buy the game to play with my daughter because she said it was good. A simple tutorial on the mechanics should be standard in this day and age.  It would at least give you a fighting chance.We could never kill the shark, land on an island, or build a single thing.  When we did finally get the tools crafted and the shark showed up and ripped the 2x2 raft apart.The hitboxes on the floating debris are awful. Trying to pick up items from the ocean is hit or miss.  Any small progress is met with brutal consequences, weather from waves, sharks, and tools not lasting long.The pacing may be off for me because gathering the needed materials shouldn't be so hard.  The fun left extremely quickly for my family.  We were left scratching our heads and searching for wikis on basic tool management.I'm more of a casual gamer so I don't have a ton of time.  I tend to play with my kids whenever possible and this was something I was going to play with my daughter.  I even play ARPGs (Path of Fire, Grim Dawn, Diablo 3) and MMOs (Guild Wars 2, Elder Scrolls Online) with my kids and this experience left us wondering why was this so difficult for no reason.I've played ARK survival evolved and faired much better with hungry dinosaurs trying to kill me when I spawn.Maybe we will give it another try on Christmas break.Thanks for reading my rant.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 Kasım 2022The freaking shark attacks you the second you step off the raft, in any amount of water. It attacked me as I was standing on the shoreline like ankle deep in the water.

It's not challenging it's just annoying as all hell to not even be able to step off the raft without the shark just suddenly being right there in your face. Play subnautica instead.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 8 Kasım 2022my big issue  with this game is if your raft is destroyed there is no way to make another so that means you have to restart to a new game. or if you get separated from the raft you have to kill yourself to re-spawn back to it. I don't get that.so this was my first play through, I found a island and my raft floated away then I tried to build a new raft but could not( i had to go online trying to figure out why I could not build a new raft) then had to kill my self to respond back to the raft. Then after responding I had died two minutes  later from thirst.  it reminded me kinda like ark. there is no tutorial so you kinda just gotta figure it out on the spot. and you have to research  online how to do things. it seems like its kinda lazy to not have a tutorial.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Kasım 2022Interesting game was having a lot of fun with friends until we had to do an underwater puzzle with the shark attacking us and pufferfish we all died and lost nearly all durability in our iron tools. Not to mention you have to eat literally every 2 minutes feels like a constant grind. Iron is a nightmare to get in decent quantities. This is on normal difficulty and the game is way too punishing. Dying basically means you have to spend an hour or more to get enough iron to re-make your tools and stuff. You can't repair your tools or items. Enemy design is awful, flying birds almost impossible to hit and constantly drop stones on your head arrows are super expensive so pray you don't miss. Fighting the shark is either you have to cheese it or tank every hit. Shark takes 30 hits with the basic wooden spear to kill.i like the game a lot but dying and losing durability in all my important items completely ruined the experience.TL:DR: game is fun but if you die it's way too punishing, combat is awful enemies all have way too much health the weapons suck and you can't repair your tools.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Eylül 2022Raft is kinda fun, but the inventory management and crafting sour the otherwise decent experience for me.Storage is extremely small, and most of my stuff so far is on MY inventory except really important bits that i can't afford to lose. Crafting has way too many component items and some are incredibly tedious to get. in 4.4 hours i JUST managed to get ONE smelter furnace, because you can only really get clay and sand from islands (so if you cant stop by/find any TOUGH LUCK), and furnaces need 6 bricks to craft, then dry. Anchors you start with are ONE time use only (more clutter and component hoarding) so if you cant get one and there is an island, then tough luck, it's back to aimlessly sailing around for you.The raft is barely steerable without a helm and sometimes getting to islands or other rafts is pretty much impossible because if it. The sail doesn't even make a noticable difference in speed, it only really gives you the ability to slightly nudge yourself in some direction.The shark at first is interesting but it really is just there to draw out the game and make it more tedious then it needs to be. If it was a spawning enemy in certain places or it appeared if you stayed in water for too long i wouldn't mind, but it CONSTANTLY circling your raft means gathering resources on islands becomes tedious and annoying because you have to speedrun gathering ♥♥♥♥ while your shark-bait is active.You barely start with any good blueprints and i've yet to get an actually useful weapon, because the spear just feels awful to use. It hits slowly, has ZERO reach for being a spear, and does piss poor damage. Idk if it gets better or not, but the combat on its own is also incredibly clunky.The raft is VERY easy to get stuck on islands, and paddling against the tide(?) is awful. So many minutes wasted by just holding M1 and guessing when i can finally steer free of the island i have been stuck on. Good thing there weren't any hostile mobs cause the throwing bird is basically impossible to fight with some of the terrain and the ONE weapon you have access to. I've been spawncamped by that specific enemy so many times, I literally lost ALL of my equipment in less then 2 minutes.overall, the game is very tedious (and not the fun kind) and progress feels incredibly slow and randomized. i am sure it gets better as i advance in tech, but with how fast i have advanced SO FAR i'm not sure i wanna continue honestly",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 12 Eylül 2022The graphics are good and the idea is great! It is an arcadey survivor game which does not take into account all elements of typical survival, only water, food and world dangers. Would be more fun if you had to make shelter, escape heat/cold etc. The game was fun for a while, but then you realise that the game is on an infinite loop with a small number of unique island reappearing over and over again. The more you mine, the more unique things you seem to find in the world, and it was fun to build the raft! but the breaking thing for me was that on some islands you would find unmanned trading stations (like wtf, where did they come from?) and there you can trade with the computer I guess? But this broke the last element of survival for me...",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 12 Eylül 2022Initally I loved Raft. The initial gameplay loop was fun and upgrading my raft was satisfying. However, the longer it went on the less I liked it. There seems to be no actual official tutorial or help, you are expected to go to a Wiki or work out how to use things by trial and error. Would it really have killed the developers to actually write a proper tutorial? Also, the upgraded components that you spend so much time trying to get seem to make little difference and/or wear out ridiculously quickly. I'm not sure if the leather armour, for example, makes any difference at all. Sharks and warthogs seem to do the same amount of damage whether I'm wearing it or not.Those were not my biggest problems however. The framerate, for me, has now made the game completely unplayable. My pc is not great but neither is it terrible. I initially turned down most of the settings and managed to get a framerate I was happy with and it was fine as I upgraded my raft, added a 2nd floor and built the radio receiver. However, things took a turn for the worse when I was able to craft ammo for the net catcher and grab a few animals. Great, I thought, I can get wool, eggs and milk and craft new stuff. I established a small animal enclosure with 2 llamas, 1 chicken and 1 goat. I don't think that's exactly excessive. The game seems to disagree however as I am now getting an average of about 5 frames a second with it sometimes dropping to 2! This problem seems to persist whether or not I am on my raft or even in visual sight of it. I cannot imagine the sort of (lack of) optimization that can cause so severe a problem. It's a real shame because the game was so enjoyable at first but the framerate means it is now completely unplayable for me. I suppose I could get rid of my animals and see if it then becomes playable but I refuse to jump through hoops to try and play a game so badly coded. If you have a ninja pc then it I guess it may be ok for you.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 19 Ağustos 2022I got this game cause it looked like something I could delve into with friends and family and attempt to survive the harsh seas while drifting to and fro on my raft while exploring the unknown wonders of the ocean and islands before me in my travels. I wanted to love this game, I really did. I've done survival games in the past so I knew what I was getting myself into, but this is a whole new mix of mess. The amount of time you are drifting on the very wide, bleak ocean feels like an eternity. Which gets old very fast. There just isn't enough to see. Occasionally you might see some sea turtles, or manta rays maybe even some dolphins. But those moments are fleeting and few. I wish there was more exploration underwater as well as islands with purpose. All the islands I've visited had flowers, for paint, and an occasional fruit to eat and a tree or two to chop down for wood and leafs. It would be nice if each island felt unique, had some sort of reason you'd be curious and actually want to visit. A landmark of interest, or a cool treasure to find, but they did not. Some deserted ships or other boats you could find out at sea for exploration would be cool. Instead you find some makeshift raft with a loot box on it. Would be cool to be able to add it to your raft, like an upgrade, or offer a piece of clothing or something. The character choices are also very forgettable, I feel a simple create your own character system would of worked perfect for this, and finding other npc's could unlock features or clothing options instead of adding more forgettable characters to the game. A variety in sharks would be cool too. Especially since you can kill it, and more of the same just keeps coming at you, it gets very repetitive and very boring fairly fast. This could use some DLC to add more life into this game. Feel it would work better as a cellphone game then one you'd want to constantly revisit to simply see more of the same thing, over and over again. I'm kinda surprised this is the final chapter and isnt still in early access. Just feels like it stopped short of something great. Lets hope the Dev's add more content in the furture with DLC packs. Pirate costumes, Sunken ships, more sea life, octopus/kraken attacking the raft, Hammer Head sharks.... something. I have not tried creative mode at the point of this review, so I can not comment on that feature, just main game and co-op.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 18 Ağustos 2022TLDR;I think the developers should have really thought out the story and game play mechanics a lot more. And to not involve extended walking around on land for a game that doesn't even have a map. Its part exploration, part puzzle, part sandbox. Its great and wrong at the same time. ⭐⭐⭐ _  _ 3/5Don't get me wrong. This game isn't terrible or anything, its just that the game mechanics suck. The art style, sounds and models are great... for the most part. For exampleThe meter on the battery charger is the wrong way around.There are two tanks on the water storage tank. WHY??????Snow mobile is excessively slippery. I'm sure they aren't supposed to be.They also get stuck in stupid places, like on staircases and easy to crash and stuck into walls/cliff sides on Temperance.The story makes no real sense. For a game that's about a raft and it periodically requires you to go on land to solve puzzles to gain.... parts for your raft??I have more but really its a good game that should have received more thorough bug hunting play through sessions.I don't know how to describe the story. I think the actual story is great, but why the puzzles? They don't seem to exist for a particular reason, just another challenge to inconvenience the player. Temperance is probably the most annoying level I've played, and I thought Balboa was bad. There is literally a huge chunk of ice surrounding parts of the island for a large distance. And none of it is mapped on your 'radar'.It would be great if there was an option to build on islands at some point.There are also a number of bugs in this game but they are mostly cosmetic or just plain funny. You can fish just about anywhere, including on top of a cliff, right through the terrain. Even through the top most level of your raft!Basically all of the enemies are carbon copies of about 4, maybe 5 base types and they all share one core weakness; EXCEPT FOR THAT FU**ING BOULDER HURLING BIRD! WHY???. You can get behind just about all enemies and keep hitting them, including Bruce for an easy victory. It ruins the game once you know this. I'm going to build a giant raft that looks like an upside down pyramid since that is actually a think that is possible. Now they just need to add elevators. Thanks for reading!",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 Ağustos 2022Yet another game that left early access far too early. This game has the most broken save system I have ever seen in 30+ years of playing computer games. At least the ones that didn't allow saving behaved more predictably than this game. The devs have gone out of their way to make it difficult to roll back saves, but they didn't bother to make sure that the game works well enough to prevent you from having to roll back. Rolling back a save means instant death when you load in, and for some reason the devs thought it was a good idea to combine that with deleting a large portion of your inventory upon death with the 'Normal' game settings. You will just have to pray that the game doesn't decide to delete the things that are vital for your survival, or respawn you under an island.The devs were however generous enough to let players choose a game mode that doesn't delete all their stuff on death, but that also reduce the difficulty of pretty much every survival aspect of the game to the point where they may as well no longer exist.As for the gameplay itself, floating around can be pretty chill, unless you want to try single player, in which case you will spend most of your time killing the same shark over and over again. Outside of the story locations, you will however have seen pretty much everything the game has to offer within a couple of hours. The islands just have too little variation to be interesting beyond that. Most research/equipment can be unlocked after your first visit to an island, which leaves very little sense of progression.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 17 Ağustos 2022The exploration of the islands is just not interesting in the slightest and the obstacles during exploration are just annoying feel too inorganic.

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ağustos 2022Raft fundamentally asks me to operate against my better instincts and for a survival game that drives me mad.   In this game you are the survivor of a ruined world, covered in ocean.   Clinging to a small hunk of wood, you must use your hook to slowly gather supplies and eventually turn your insignificant joke of a piece of plywood into a truly impressive raft replete with water purifiers, crop baskets, and other amenities.   By way of challenge you are perpetually hunted and harassed by a hungry shark who makes it his personal goal to tear your raft apart and generally be an irritant.Now my natural reaction to being consigned to the ocean with a hungry shark trying to eat me was to find land.  And find land I did: for there are many islands in this world.   Jumping from my raft and wading into land, I proceeded to roam the island collecting food.   With no thought to my hunk of wood, I happily spent the night on the island.And yet come morning I noticed something odd - there were no supplies in the ocean.   Where had they gone? Well, a new raft could be built: I had plenty of materials.   Ahh but in Raft, one does not simply BUILD a new raft.  For you see, the original four raft tiles that you start with are the center of the Raft universe.   They dictate all resource spawns and must be built out from in order for you to survive.   Yes, you can build nothing without your original raft tiles.Having thus unceremoniously lost my first game, and having had to turn to the internet to discover the unwritten rule of the game, I returned with a new world to start another journey.   The early  game is tedious as you divide time between farming supplies, farming food, and chasing off the shark.    Once you have built some infrastructure and secured your food and water supply however, the game turns into a fairly uninteresting loop of chasing off the shark while farming up more and more resources.   Fairly realistic storm and tide modeling proves to be a frustration but not a true challenge to overcome.Raft does have an intriguing diversion in its in-game story, which is told mainly from you finding landmarks and exploring them for notes and records.   While I greatly enjoyed this aspect of the game, I found the tedium of trying to build while constantly being harassed by the shark on the whole to be an unpleasant experience.Raft has a lot of charm with some delightfully moody music and an easy visual style.   It's sandbox construction is sure to appeal to many gamers.   For myself however, I found the game annoying to play.   A fantastic upgrade to this game would be a detailed difficulty slider that would allow me to tune the game to my liking, things like reducing the shark's ability to attack without also nerfing the survival elements of the game.   I was hoping Raft would be the game that would allow me to build my island paradise but the truth is with Raft, you'll never be getting off your boat.   You just sail on for eternity with one lone shark forever pursuing you.I neither recommend nor not recommend this game.   I am flatly neutral on it.   Thanks Steam for not having that as an option.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 28 Temmuz 2022A really nice game, but not for me.I found the story rather boring. Sure, you can build a cool raft. But other systems like farming crops and animals, or cooking, are somewhat limited. Important ingredients like mushrooms are quite rare and can only be found in caves on certain islands. And there is barely any use for some of the resources yet, so things like clay bowls or buckets are used up in cooking. Which doesn't make sense, but I guess it generates a need to gather those resources anew to create new ones.Yes, I really like the food and farming part in survival games. And this game sucks in those areas.Too bad none of my friends play Don't Starve together anymore. I guess they prefer having to deal with a shark every 5 minutes instead of the occasional tree guard.",N/A

Oh you accidentally fell in the water for 2 seconds? well there's a shark who just somehow knows to be right up your ass the moment you fall in and eats you. Farm an island for like 30 mins just to get blown up by a random fart fish who does 50% of your hp as a dot and you lose everything and there's no way to get it back? spend 10 mins chasing a chicken to kill and eat it only to find out it has absolutely no value and you get nothing for it? ya really alluring concepts here with this game... NOT. what a waste of time. You spend most of the start of the game struggling for food and 95% of what you eat barely has any value, you get like 5% of your food bar. yet a cup of water fills like 25%.. this is a survival game and irl its literally the opposite, you can survive so much longer without food than water, why does food just basically do nothing? and you gotta eat like every 5 mins or you just become a slug who cant run or do anything.. Just basic upkeep is a miserable grind and you barely get to progress because you're just struggling to get the bare minimum as this annoying ass shark eats your boat and you gotta waste resources to fix it.

"Yayınlanma: 11 Temmuz 2022The game is really good, when checking streams about it I can see why it's entertaining. But it didn't click with me, and here's why :I was playing it with a couple of friends, and after three hours of playtime we just realised that we hadn't advanced much, and that our experience was kinda ... boring. From what I've seen on streams and videos, the game gets crazy good in its later stages, but we ended up giving up because of how slow the beginning of our playthrough was. The items are rather scarce in the beginning, and because the shark bites the boat, the food meter goes down, etc ... you always have something to do. But then after a while you realised : oh, I've been doing kind of the same things for three hours.During those 3 hours, one was enjoyable (learning about the mechanics of the game, new stuff to build, islands to explore) and two were just filled with a whole lot of nothing, just fighting the shark when it comes for the raft, fishing, hooking stuff ... and after a while it just became obvious that the time we had wasn't ""bad"", but not good either, just really, really ""meh"", so we decided to stop.I think the game is ok if you're willing to go through a rather boring (charming but still boring) beginning, I just don't know how long this ""slow part"" lasts, but if you're not absolutely sure that you'll like it, I would say pass on it. Me and my friends can't even refund the game, because it took us slightly too much time to realise that we were just not enjoying it, and that the good part was too far off.",N/A

Sailing around to find an island (of which there are about 2 variants per biome per big/small island), hooking resources, killing shark, go on rafting....Game is definitely better in multiplayer than in singleplayer, because then you can at least chat with others and the game world does not seem completely dead.Also, the much praised relaxing atmosphere is quickly lost when every 5 minutes a shark attacks (which, by the way, also likes to glitche over your raft) or a seagull wants to eat away a crop.The tools get destroyed and can't be repaired for less material.

Axes can cut down 5-6 trees before they break. It is frustrating, because you have to return to your raft multiple times when exploring bigger islands. The swimming gear breaks even when exploring the underwater area of one small island and is not worth crafting at all.The concept of the Raft is brilliant though. It's a base that you will always bring with you and you steadily automate more and more.I only recommend it if you want to build your Raft, If you want a good story or fun combat look elsewhere.It also still has a few bugs and even though it is out of the Early Access phase, it feels less complete than Valheim.Concept 8/10Building 7/10Crafting 4/10Story 5/10Combat 2/10Jump and Run 3/10",N/A

It's ""a lot"" of content in a sense that you will spend HOURS trying to get through theirpoorly made platformer—TWICE.One weird obstacle to jump on with is fine, 2 or 3 of it, fineee. But another 3 or 4 of that to top it off? Ugh. — Okay, assume you got through that after an hour or so. Good! Now here's a few puzzles where you climb up and down, and majority of the time, it's easier to just fall off and take the damage cuz they didn't think this through, they just wanted to be done with it. It was about 6-7 ladders with a floor on each, because there's numbers. Grab a pen or memorize it all, you'll be shuffling through floors anyway... Only to find yourself in the beginning of the platformer —You have to do it again.2 of us were in that island for 4 real world hours. Imagine doing all that alone where no one's looking at the other end of a pipe for you to check if it's working.Don't get this if you don't have friends to play it with. There'sA LOT of repetitive tasksyou won't be able to automate till the last 2 islands.Most of your time will be spent on planting, watering the plants, harvesting, replanting, watering, cooking it all up, drinking water, and refilling your purifier, while making sure you stop at every island you see just to get more materials. There's never enough to build up a ""stock,"" you can pack up when going through the story Islands. Once you get better equipments, it changes to having to replace the batteries regularly and making a lot of fuel. They take raw materials, so build a farm.Combat is absolute bonk.Hit box is hit or miss, weird clipping. Parts of the animals' body go through you or the floor, making them hard to hit and collect once you're done with it. You can also get through certain areas just byglitchinginto it.Prior to release, devs decided to re-write the whole story and crammed it all together just to be done with it. Story is meh and level design is just absolutely horrible.I play a lot of survival/crafting/exploration games and don't leave a lot of reviews.It's either a really good game or it's just full of absolute bs and people needs to know.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022crashes, still a beta.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022Do not run this game on low end computers. It is incredibly laggy and makes the game impossible even on Easy mode.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 3 Temmuz 2022Who should buy this:I played for 17 hours with two friends. We got past part 4/~9 of the story. Our raft was tricked out, with two levels and separate areas for doing every conceivable task. There were several of every station for processing speed and chests everywhere. I am aware that that is not optimal for getting through the game quickly.Visuals: 2/5 okayGood for an indie game, but not visually stunning by any means.Gameplay: 4/5 really-liked or 1/5 dislikedThis game is two games in one. I really liked the survival-crafting game that filled the first 10 hours. However, after our raft had been tricked-out, there was no longer any struggle to survive and there was no new crafting to be done either. Instead, the entire rest of the game seemed to be boring fetch quests. You go somewhere, run around the place, and pick up papers on the floor. Yes, you get nice audio-logs which tell cute little stories and allude to the mystery of the sea. However, to me it was completely not worth doing the fetching just for that. Blueprints are locked behind the inane fetch quest that is the story, and the game slows to an unbearable pace. I didn't like that part of the gameplay, and so quit. Oh, also the combat is unsatisfying. You can stand inside enemies, and when you do you can miss the hit indicator (blood). There is no hit indicator for pvp (there is, but it's so subtle you can't catch it because you're clipping in and out of them). The aiming reticle has a circle in it which obstructs your view of what you are hitting. The circle becomes extra-thick when you are using a bow, which is honestly where you want the least obstruction to your view. Annoying.Grind: There can be a lot if you let there be.I'm pretty sure if you are a single person and speed-run the story, then you will not have to grind for many resources. However, because me and my friends wanted to build the raft the way we did, we ended up spending hours grinding for various materials, which was not the most fun to do. On top of that, the game has a time-based grind system, which I found annoying. Every second you exist, there are various resources being used up all around your boat. That means that the grinding loop is extended, as while you grind for certain resources, other resources are depleting. It's not a particularly fun feeling, and it felt like the game was punishing me and my friends for wanting to have fun and create a big raft.Sound: 2.5/5 okay and likedWhen a song is playing, the game feels very alive and it's great. However, when a song isn't playing, the game feels a lot more dead. However, when songs are set to playa constantly, some of the magic is lost.Story: 4/5 really likedThe story snippets were very cool. However, I didn't find the grind worth it for the story. If the story is just audio logs, then I can get a similar experience by reading a book or audiobook.Bugs: none noticedPrice: I don't feel bad that I spent $15 on this game. However, if I were given the chance to do things over, I would wait until it was $10 or lower.Difficulty: Not at all difficult. Just painful when you have to grind.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Temmuz 2022I just cannot recommend this game.  The game loop, especially for starting a new game is unnecessarily difficult.You'll be spending 80% of your time desperately trying to gather wood to repair your boat from the constant shark attacks and refill your water purifier and grill.  It feels like a wood simulator more than a survival game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 Mayıs 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesithis game is an extremely well polished grindfest that might appeal to people who want a ""feeding a man with a tapeworm"" simulator. your food and water bar go down so fast that cooking food will likely involve starving nearly to death several times up until you can make the grill, wherein you will be upgraded to *almost* starving to death. water is slightly better because you can store a bit more, which is a saving grace (but only after you get the upgraded water source).  after making a sustainable farm you have two choices: either run back to your ship over and over while exploring the larger islands, or waste a bunch of storage space having enough food to explore without dying.fishing is also, similarly, tedious grindy and annoying. one fishing rod takes a ton of materials and doesn't even give you enough fish to be worth the effort in the slightest.the shark attacking the raft isn't much of a big deal after you get a decent sized boat, although gathering wood before you have a bunch of catching nets (which need wood) is a monumentally grindy and annoying task. hooking stuff coming in is maybe supposed to make gathering driftwood and leaves more interesting? but it fails at that miserably because it takes no real skill and is, once again, just tedious and annoying.they also give you just as many leaves as they do wood, which is stupid because you use wood for way, way, more and I'm currently sitting on hundreds of leaves that I have no use for.it would make a lot more sense for wood to come in more frequently since you actually need it way more but if the developers were capable of that kind of forethought I wouldn't be leaving this review in the first place.what it comes down to, ultimately, is that nothing is as fun as it should be to carry a game where you have to repeat these actions basically every five minutes at best and every 30 seconds at worst. I wish I could understand why this game is so popular and beloved, but I don't and I probably never will. I just don't see the fun in minecraft where the hunger bar is more likely to kill you than the final boss.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 9 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI like the idea that this was a game started by students and it is a great idea. Giving this idea of what it is like if you crashed in the ocean from a air plane or something. But I think after playing this many times and the RAFT version on android and ipad I have come to the conclusion of this games (unlike reasonable zombie games):1 - the shark frequency is really too high. Realistically the sharks do not chase someone on a raft because they dont normally eat people so they would not look for food like that.2 - since this is a realistic game then i am not sure you would end up in the water raft with a HOOK ???3 - I wonder if the garbage in the water is too much?4 - the way this game has the rendering is kind of wierd I dont get this kind of drag but maybe it is the water graphics5 - islands disappear when your raft goes off. I was playing with my family and they took off in the raft. Not nice right. After a while the island just DISAPPEARS. Not good programming. The program should check and if there is a survivor on the island then it should disappear.6 - When on the island there is almost NO items to toss the hook for. Yes they do this to make you go back on the raft but reasonably people might want to farm a little for food and wood right?7 - Multiplayer would be nice if we get matched with other similar8 - I think some of these things might make this game worth it. I wish I had not bought this. BUT THANK YOU developers to give us a first draft of this game concept9 - I hope it is not like this for real but the ocean is full of garbage. But in reality it is full of plastics. Maybe the game can have a setting for that and then gear building to plastics. BUT what could we build with plastics without fire or glue.Sighh did i over think this ?,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 5 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI want to like the game but there's one major flaw, early on before you have a paddle, you can get your raft stuck easily as it's ran into island terrain, and with no means to reset your raft's position (as far as I know) that means you have no choice but to start a new game. Also, even if you do have a paddle if you die with it, there's absolutely no way to recover any items you die with which is also very frustrating. If those issues were fixed (and I do consider them issues, not gameplay features) I would probably change my rating.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 30 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft, with the amount of time put into the games development is really nice! but It does have some flaws that really pushes me back from recommending it at this moment. The game isn't very original and can be very repetitive at times. This is probably due to the game still being developed, but It really doesn't have any aspects that makes it stand out as a game. There are more fleshed out and better developed games in the same genre like subnautica that has a ton of more content and experiences to enjoy. At the moment, the price is just way too steep to be worth it, and until more development is put in, ill probably change or edit my review on it once i get the full release.story:there really isn't any, there is some bits here and there in the game, from the landmarks you go to. The genre doesn't really lend itself to story, so this could later become a nice factor that makes the game more original. I like the idea of it, but again it really takes a BIG backseat to the rest of the gameplay. When you encounter these bits of info is really random as the islands that are randomly generated are usually large islands with nothing really special, which is very annoying. It adds to the reason of it's repetitiveness, and can be frustrating.Building and multiplayer:The building and ways to customize your raft is interesting and I really like the tools they have implemented so far, but it can be a big feat and very costly time and resource wise especially during early game when playing single player. On the note of single player, it is actually pretty serviceable, but it's hard to really get used to/endure the repetitiveness of the game without playing with others. No matter how bare bones or cut and paste games in this genre can be, multiplayer can make it all the more fun. if you don't really have friends or anyone that will shell out $20+ for this game, it won't be as good as an experience.Graphics:The art style and graphics of the game are pretty nice and different. I like what they did with the colors and semi cartoonish mobs that you get to encounter. There's not much else to say other than that bugs tend to be abundant with the ai, and there have been many instances where the models would just clip into the land or run in place. There is not a lot of mobs believe it or not. There's only 11 so far, and you will be killing the shark (the mob that is constantly around your raft) probably thousands of times. The game can get stale as a resultOVERALL: not really worth the money, wait til there's more content, or better yet invest in a better game. The Summer sale is still on, so you can get a full and better game for the same price or slightly more than their discount. If price doesn't matter for you, go ahead, but make sure you have friends to play it with.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 19 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiis actually fun, but still needs some balancing, especially early on.you can:- get stuck to an island. sometimes the wind just move your raft to an island. if you don't have enough resource for a sail, you're stuck there for days. even if you can craft a paddle, the wind will just move you to the same place. stuck there for a few day and you'll run out of resource to filter water and cook food. what about those woods and junk in the ocean? well, they don't move to you, you move to them. so if your raft stop moving, no wood will come floating to you.- feel lost. the game has literally no tutorial at all. and you can feel lost  easily. it really force you to look up on a wiki.once you get a smelter though, everything gets better",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI feel like in order to really enjoy this game, you need a group of at least 4-5 people playing at a time. The resource requirement for items you can craft is just too imbalanced, it takes ages to acquire said items- and defending off the shark that's just constantly trying to eat you or your raft really hinders this. Also not a big fan of how fast tools deteriorate. (Yeah... tools eventually break.)",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 13 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game was not at all what I was expecting. After needing to create 3 worlds (the first was a test world just to get my bearings, the second one bugged out so bad that the island I was on just disappeared, and the third was just a shark attacking my raft before I had time to gather materials to fix it so I just kept feeling like I was going in circles). It has potential to be fun but it needs some work. Also, since when do sharks eat wood? Just wondering lol I feel like if they fixed some aspects it might be fun but after playing for 2 hours, I feel like I started out with more than I ended up with and for a survival game, it shouldn't feel like that. My raft kept being eaten before I could gather materials and I made a lot of headway on the first world but the shark ate my raft after I had crafted a water purifying system. I kept dying of thirst from that point and it was just annoying and I feel like I wasn't enjoying it after the first world. I'm sorry for the bad review, typically I give games more of a chance but this was just extremely disappointing for me.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt's ok for about 20 hours or so, but then you just kind of realise there's not much more to it.I initially put fun rather than ok, but it's not really. Everything about the game is tedious.Cooking for example you need to take 4 individual components, lay them out separately, add a bunch of wood, then click start cooking, and the end result gives you something only marginally better than just cooking an individual component and eating it.Everything in the game has a very low durability amount, you can craft flippers and an oxygen tank, they'll be good for maybe 1 or 2 trips under water, then both will need replacing. Recrafting them then takes most of the resources you just gathered nullifying the point of both crafting the upgrades and the resource hunt.Want to kill a boar? Ok, your spear will break before you've killed one boar lol. So make sure you craft 2 or more! Oh and spears cost 8 planks of wood each to make. I guess your character isn't much of a carpenter as that seems like a lot of wastage, which is odd considering a wooden spear is just a stick with one end sharpened.There are mods that reduce the tedium, however using them makes you realise the game IS tedium. For each mod you use that reduces tedium and/or increases quality of life you make the game itself gradually disappear.Combat is by far the weakest part of the game. Animals will clip through you, and your attacks will miss despite being on target as the hitboxes are all wrong. The shark attacks your raft on a timer of 2 mins or so. If you aren't there to defend it you lose a foundation. If there was anything on that foundation you lose that too. You can play the game in peaceful mode, but see above, less tedium = less game.Maybe all of this will be fixed in updates as it's still early access, but honestly I doubt it. Unless they completely re-balanced items and crafting, and completely redid combat from the ground up. On top of that the game is being developed at a glacial pace to the extent there are frequent posts in the discussion forums asking if the game is dead.Recommend wishlisting to monitor development progress. Maybe watch some lets plays on Youtube and see if it appeals.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game has a two flaws, The game actually renders around the raft, not the players. This means if you spend too long on an island, you'll actually be YEETED back to the raft. The reason this is a *problem* is flaw number 2, if your raft is broken all the way, you'll just be thrown into an ocean, and *cant* actually use the building tool to just make a new foundation! So you are softlocked. This tends to happen early game when you don't actually have any way of stopping the raft, because in order to make a anchor, you need to visit an island!",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiUnless someone has a high end computer or one with a decent graphic's card, I wouldn't suggest getting this game.

It's really fun to play with friends otherwise you're sitting there stressing out tryin to make sure you don't die and the shark doesn't destroy everything while fighting with lag. Then comes the sliding, with how bad it lags even on the lowest it will go it always feels like you're gonna slide off the raft regardless of how big it is. Not having a feel for the edge and then end up in the water just to have the shark take a couple of bites. Fighting to get back on the raft throughout the lag is certainly not a fun time either.",N/A

Also the shark will stuck on you and hunt you always, trying to avoid him its really hard, even if you have the stick to attack him when is running to you for an attack, you cant really dodge it. Also what is the purpose of the load world? IF you cant roll back to a certent point? If you die and try to load a previous load you just cant, it will just appear you dead but with previous save. That is really bad, especially if you are solo playing, that you can loose everything and start again your main tools/weapons from the begining. It can prove diffucult nearly impossible to some areas that you dont have access to loost places, or you are not able to collect wood to produce the basic tools again.

"Yayınlanma: 18 Şubat 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft is a fun game for about 2 days then you realize there really isn't much content in the game and the bugs / shotty development of mechanics makes me recoil at the sound of hearing ""want to play raft?"". The development is extremely slow as well. Over the course of 5 years of updates we have received the most minimal content you can receive, 1 or 2 new items, maybe a new animal, sometimes a new area to explore that's essentially been designed by a 10 year old with no thought put into the environment. The raft mechanic it self is horrible. Your raft constantly clips down into the ocean, the wind mechanics don't make any sense. You always drift in one direction despite the wind going in another direction with your sail down. There's no real story just a simple synopsis to explain why your on a raft. The movement of what few animals you encounter are poorly animated and for a giant ocean you only ever see a shark. Building mechanics are clunky as hell with snap points not working and build-ables not doing what the description says.. While i understand its early access we have to put in to perspective that even 5 years of development for the amount of quality and content we have is very sad. The world of Raft is as big as an ocean but its content and quality are as deep as a puddle and at 20 bucks its not worth it. Go buy Valheim don't waste your money on this game.",N/A

It will start to lag really badly, and other players on your boat won't be able to steer it properly. I was so miserable on my friends boat, we had to switch to mine because they were trying to make a huge galleon ship and play it. Where my boat was sill a ship...but it was 1/3 the size of their ship. That stuff is only for creative mode.Treasure hunting is excruciatingly painful on this game. The treasure will spawn inside of mountains where your character cannot reach. So you'll spend a longgggg time trying to find the treasure realizing you can never reach it. Or you will get the specific islands like I did. Where it will spawn on top of the mountain where the only way to reach it is to build a ramp from your ship then jump down precisely to get to the treasure. Then I sailed around, and ended up back at the same island, running around with my metal detector until I realized it was the same island with the crappy treasure spawn. I was so enraged, the game earned itself a negative review. The only way to get islands to reset is to sail to the edge of the map, or far away enough to them to reset. So getting the tiki and painting achievements was extremely hard doing it the legit way without using mods.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiNo recommendation here. When i first tried this game it was an extremely frustrating experience. The game is unbalanced and the constant shark harrassment is beyond annoying.The amount of food and water you have to consume in a single ingame day in the early stages leaves you with barely any resources to actually progress. You're busy refilling planks after planks for fuel to grill single, small fishes and cooking up tiny ammounts (cup sized) of water, while the hunger and thirst bars are constantly draining. Tools are always on the verge of breaking, eating up even more resources. Heck even scarecrows break for some reason.All that ontop of the constant shark harassment, wich also requires you to constantly repair your float at the cost of planks again.It gets a little better once you get the advanced stuff but even so stuff still constantly breaks. The saving grace for this game is the possibillity of modding. Sadly there are not many to pick from either but they help.Apparently the game opens up once you've built a radio station. I'm not there yet and getting there is quite the nightmare imho.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 21 Ekim 2020Ürün ücretsiz alındıErken Erişim İncelemesiFun but it shoots you in the leg crippling you with its terrible progression and lack of tutorial.The materials you need to progress equipment and the story are underwater on island shores. This is a cool concept but the shark makes it near impossible to gather resources. There is almost always at least one shark following you around (not so much on islands where it just circles and wanders around the island (until it finds you)) making mining for metal, scrap, rock, copper, sand, and clay impossible (all except for perhaps rock vital to doing ANYTHING important). This game is impossible for all the wrong reasons. It teaches you WATER = BAD with how the shark IMMEDIATELY launches at you if you fall in the water, which is common with the sometimes buggy raft, so if you didn't know you might've spent however long just mindlessly cruising stopping at islands for topside stuff like fruit or wood because the game just fails to tell you core mechanics.If I was the dev I would add a cooldown to shark respawns, like:Easy - Shark doesn't respawn until you weigh anchor off an islandMedium - Shark doesn't respawn until one in-game day passesHard - 10 minute window until shark respawnsI got so frustrated I didn't get to the point of deep-sea diving so I won't comment on sharks in that capacity.The game is so fun and after getting some better tools it really is just the story content with occasional grinding to restock and fun sailing but god it punishes you making it way too tough to get your feet off the ground. There needs to be a massive rework of enemy function as well as a tutorial before this game continues in the direction its headed (deeper storytelling).HOWEVER: if you have someone else to deal with the shark for you it's a breeze, but consider playing on Easy cause it takes 3-4 hits to kill and you don't get inventory dropped or returned it's deleted (which is BS)",N/A
Yayınlanma: 15 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiMe and my friend decided to get a copy of this game.

Enemies are almost impossible to hit with the bow weapon and the flying enemy is faster then your arrows flying through the air.

I can't revert to an earlier save, where I'm not killed by the magical invisible bird, and I lost everything I had on my character.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiFirst 2 hour impression on the game is pretty poor. Bought this one with my friend for the sale and decided to give it a go. Our experience was very bland, repetitive, and frustrating. Our Raft magically got stuck against a random island several times within 10 minutes of starting a fresh game. Which forced us to constantly keep swimming way out of the way to gather resources by hand to make a paddle, while dealing non stop with the shark.In addition, to being stuck against a random island, the rest of our game play was our Raft being completely stationary in the middle of the ocean (with sails). which led to countlessly fetching items on the hook for a while.I don't understand where all the content comes from this game. As far as I can see, it's just sail randomly, get caught up against islands, and fetch random materials to craft with from the ocean with the hook.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 12 Haziran 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiPretty nice game, wonderful progression, very relaxing even when a shark is chasing you. Just one teensy, tiiiiny little problem. You get to choose which difficulty you want your world to be; easy, normal, and hard, right? I don't want to really breeze right through a game, but nor do I want to be stupidly stressed via an ironman run, so I choose normal. Except the game devs don't tell you one small detail. When you die on normal, all your items? GONE. Dissapeared. Not even in a backpack where you died so you can slog back and get them, just GONE. Had essential items (like blueprints and limited items) with your body? Those are gone too. And even better, the devs went OUT OF THEIR WAY to make sure you can't reload a previous save....even though you can manually save at any time you want, which makes one assume there are backup saves. But nope, nowhere did they state normal difficulty you lose all your crap permanently, nor that you cannot backup your saves, nor that their game is essentially a roguelite. So I just wasted what precious freetime I have on a save that is now royally screwed. Thanks devs, really appreciate the transparency. Oh, and screw you too.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 30 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiWish I could give it a middle thumb for weird difficulty. On normal and above you lose everything on death which IMO is boring and lame. Its the only reason I play on easy. Losing everything on death especially when death in this game is weird(more on that later) is just really unfun and feels out of place in this game. Why not do what every other game does and make you drop stuff on death(or even have you lose a % like green hell)? No idea. The deaths in the game tend to be you dying slowly to shark or the weird AI just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on you cause there is no block and some moves are buggy to dodge. Like the rats and normal bears are kinda brain dead to fight but the pigs are just buggy. The games difficulty is weird enough to make a good game go to an eh game.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 27 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is fun, but it gets old very fast. There is a lot of potential but right now it's a very short game. There are also so many bugs, glitches, and flat-out annoyances that make this game hard to play.Some of the biggest annoyances I have:Seagulls eating your plants every 15 seconds.Seagulls will fly through walls and eat plants. Even in enclosed areas with no openings.Farming plants on your raft will not drop seeds. This makes farmingcompletely useless. This is especially annoying when growing flowers for your beehives to make biofuel when the seagulls eat them all while I'm exploring an island.The shark attacking your boat every 30 seconds.Hunger and thirst completely drain after what seems like 5 minutes.There are only a dozen or so islands to find, and it's the same thing repeated over and over for the entirety of the game.Finding enough metal ore to armor your raft would take hundreds of hours to mine. Each island only has about 4 - 6 ore. Each armor takes 2 ore. You have around 200 - 300 squares on your raft. Do the math.If you die on Normal or Hard, your inventory is permanently gone.Tools and craftables wear out extremely fast. Even the metal ones.I have a PC that can max out most games with 80-100fps. Raft runs at 30fps on lowest settings.There's so little to do. Completing the entire ""story"" takes 3 or 4 hours then it's just floating around the ocean endlessly.This game is genuinely very fun. But there are so many cons that is outweighs the pros tenfold.",N/A

Yes, I know it has Easy, Peaceful and Creative as choices.On easy, I lost my raft after anchoring and spending a few minutes on an island. Most likely due to a shark attack where my anchor was placed, and caused the raft to drift away pretty quickly. Peaceful, sure, but what's the point, really.Creative, great. but I would like to play that after playing the normal game.The shark attacks are far too frequent. Just personally did not enjoy the game.Great concept. Poor execution.Refund requested.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt's tough to get invested in an open world survival crafting game when an entire island you're parked on may just disappear.  In fact, if you jump off your raft and don't anchor it, the game follows the raft and will remove the island.  I get removing off screen assets so you're not bloating resources being used by the game.  But this is the first I've heard of removing on screen assets in order to follow an offscreen raft.

"Yayınlanma: 21 Ocak 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesihi got this game a while ago it was fun at first but after a while i got board because i had the same routine everyday i was thinking maybe you could add some sort of random event like a heli could fly over and it could have a chance of seeing you but then the heli fails and your now stuck on an island and have to start from scratch exect for a few random things in your back pack. or like make the bigger islands appear more often something like that sorry for the negative review but everyday is the same so i got board. P.S. when i got board i had started making bricks and goo so maybe make it like something around that also add like a multiplayer for OTHER PEOPLE who are not your friends and you could send an invite and it would pop up on their screen and if they click yes then you would join their world otherwise if they clicked no you would not join, also while typing this the invite could have a block button on it so you could block and unblock them just in case someone spammes it please read this review i was dissapointed when i got it and i never play it :( :( :( please add a bit more randomness and other things also maybe add like a ship or a cruise ship :) pls do something about this thank you develepor/develepors for reading this and hopefully make this come true also i would only recommend this game if you do this :(",N/A

Yayınlanma: 5 Ocak 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiPretty boring game,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 11 Ocak 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiFirst the game is extremely repetitive in terms of constantly having to get food and water, leaving little enough time for much else, and that's on normal difficulty, I'm guessing it's worse on higher difficulties.  Second, any enemies you kill come back rather quickly, so there's really no progress in killing something because by the time you come back through you probably have to face it again.  Last is the fact that while they have a ""back up"" system, it only restores your raft/world, not your player.  So saving your game is useless in terms of if you die in a bad situation, your screwed, you just don't get your inventory back even by going back to an old save, this is just infuriating, I can only imagine that there save game system was so terrible in terms of corruption that the implemented this as a work around because any other game in the world if you have multiple saves, it's to save your character, not everything else in the world.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Ocak 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhat I don't understand about the game is the development, the updates are planned so it's like they were already planning to release an unfinished game. Gameplay wise, I guess it's kinda fun, it's more of a slow burner and after the endgame, there's not much to do cause you've already seen everything. In my playthrough, it does get boring midway so find a friend to play with. The blueprints are unnecessary cause after you got it, it's added to your research table but then it becomes useless. Story is a bit boring, it's just like a post-apocalyptic world but with flood. Catching animals with the net is a hassle. Warthogs and screechers still bug out. Verdict: Just finish making the damn game then publish it or at least have beta testers so you can debug it first. For now, I don't think it's worth the price. just wait for it to finish first or at lest at 30% discount.",N/A

There needs to be more enemies.BUT there are some pros like the multiplayer feature and being able to take your time throughout playing raft whether it be crafting and organizing your chests.

I enjoy watching it played, and I'm sure its very fun to play witrh freinds. But for $20 it's just not worth it for me. I had more fun playing Stranded: Deep and Subnautica. For the $20 price point you can pick up several survival games with much more to do.Currently they have islands that are tiny and only have a few key resources on them, and abandoned rafts you can scavange for a couple fo random bits of loot, but theres just not enough here.The core gameplay is throwing out your hook and reeling in resources whiel you manage your food and water meter, the water is full of sharks so you can't really go into it. Your raft get's bigger and more complicated, but its all just the saem over and over.If you are playing solo pick up subnautica or stranded: deep instead.

"Yayınlanma: 4 Nisan 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI first seen this game being played on a streamer's channel, and decided to give it a go.  Unfortunately, after playing the game, I don't really see myself playing it on a regular basis anymore.Before I list off the negative aspects of this game, I will provide some positive notes.Positives- Graphics are great- Controls are very easy to comprehend- Background music is nice and relaxing- the game is ok in theory for those who like hunter/gatherer games, and can tolerate the negative aspects as stated below.Negatives (* denotes change)* - According to information found under these reviews, this game has been in Early Access for three years now.  Judging from the comments/reviews, It doesn't appear that much of the game's aspects will change from here on.  It feels as if this game is now final version, either that or progress is really slow from the Dev's.EDIT 12/29/2021 - the dev's put in some new items, wildlife, and other misc. items, nothing to brag about, tbh.  It doesn't really change my observation.- The player doesn't have the option to alter the character's appearance in no way shape or form (i.e. can't change skin color, facial/body features, hair styles, clothing, etc.).  Unfortunately, you're stuck with what the Dev's give you, which is terrible.- Methods and materials to construct your raft are very restrictive.  For example, you have to construct walls on a floating foundation.  Why not use introduce the concept of beams into the game? This way you can construct floors, and walls above the beams, so you wouldn't have to use a floating foundation to support wall.  Another example is that you're restricted to wood/palm leaves for your raft's construction.  This really  puts a limit on the player's creativity.- To put my next point into perspective with respect to the story line....You start out on a small raft, and you have no idea why you're on the raft, nor is there any indication of how you got on the raft.  (The game doesn't even tell you there's a diary that you can access for the story line.).  The dev's really need to work on the story line!!- Choosing a difficulty from anything above 'Easy' makes you grind constantly for food and water (this is particularly annoying as you have little time for other activities in the game)- Shark attacks every five minutes...I realize its a game, but that gets annoying after playing for a while.- The player only has the ability to stack 20 items in one slot.  Guess what this means...you're going to be creating a ton of chests to hold your items  EDIT 12/29/2021 - exception of flowers (20 changed to 50), and clams (5 changed to 20...yes it started as 5).- Its a survival game, and can grow crops on your raft, raise livestock, make tools...but you don't have the ability to sustain yourself on an island...its a bit odd.- You have to live off the items in your surroundings, although you can't harvest items on the islands such as palm leaves from plants, trees lying on the ground, bamboo which grows on the shores, etc.- When the player runs its at a snails pace, while walking is slow to begin with.- Island designs are very cookie cutter, with little variation.* - You can die of hunger, thirst, getting attacked by animals...but you can fall off a cliff and not die, or get injured?  EDIT 12/29/2021 - this sorta got changed, you can kinda get hurt from a free fall...yeah.- A fishing line can be cast through a floor, and you can catch fish (basically you can fish through floors?)  I'm not sure why a player should be able to do this.- In third person view your character is bouncing constantly whilst walking and running.  It's an annoying feature which gets old real fast.- You don't have the ability to repair any of the items you create (exception of recharging batteries).- When the player is stationary on the raft, and the raft is turning...the player doesn't rotate with the raft.  This forces you to change your player's direction on the raft.- For crafting food with a bowl, you use a bowl once, and it's gone from your inventory.  Umm...you're on a raft, the game is about recycling...and what not, and you're not given the ability to re-use a bowl?  grind, grind, grind all day...- While fishing, and you catch a herring the game says you ""caught a raw herring"", or a raw mackerel...etc.  When fishing, I've never heard someone say ""I've caught a raw herring"" or ""I caught a raw mackerel"" (maybe its named that way to categorize it...to me its just odd).* - The candle in a bottle is useless, as you cant light the wick (but you can have torches constantly lit in the game?)  EDIT 12/29/2021 - this was addressed in game, and it now appears the candle is now lit.- Player doesn't have the ability to hang blueprints on the wall (but you can hang food recipes on the wall??)- Rain flows freely through the roof of whatever you constructed (doesn't matter if its comprised of palm leaves or wood).  Is it really that difficult to code rain not being able to fall through a ceiling??* - EDIT 12/29/2021 -  Seagulls now have the ability to 'lick paint off wood'....right, a seagull will lick the paint off wood...,that's just a terrible idea!tldr - IMO, don't buy this game just yet, wait until the dev's sort this game out for final release (with a release date currently unknown).  This game has alot of grinding, tons of missing features....and a really annoying shark.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiKind of a letdown. I had seen the game through videos, and was interested, but I didn't realize how frustrating the game is. You immediately start in the ocean with no explanation, which is fine, but the game's unbalanced difficulty quickly hits you in the face. If you touch the water, the shark that constantly follows your raft instantly strikes. On top of this, the hunger gauge quickly depletes. To make things worse, when you die, you lose all of your currently held items (you cannot retrieve them), and the game automatically overwrites your save.This wouldn't be a big deal, except that creating ANYTHING in this game requires a ton of items, and all of them are scarce at best. For example, creating a fishing rod requires 16 leaves, and a bunch of wood; leaves are common (if your on the ocean, I don't know why you can't just take them from the flora on the islands), but you'll only find a few a minute. Unfortunately, almost every recipe requires these leaves, because they make rope, which takes more time, as you rely on the ocean's RNG. When you tally up this time investment over a dozen or more items, one death ends up costing you an hour of progress. Even if you had backup equipment stored in chests, regathering those lost resources takes a infuriating massive amount of time.Even more annoying, is how quickly EVERY item degrades. You'd think a metal ax would last significantly longer than a stone one, but the difference is pretty small. And EVERYTHING has incredibly weak durability. If you don't actively protect your crops, birds will get them. You can build a scarecrow counter this, but then the birds eventually break that too, and it is NOT cheap to construct. The whole point of a scarecrow is keep pests away, not attract them to it.It's one thing to make a game in this genre challenging, but the developers actively went out of their way to make every aspect of this game involve micromanagement and tedium. When your raft docks at an island, you can't even explore without having your raft picked apart by sharks and boats; you just don't catch a break. And having a manual save function is sort of pointless, when the game Autosaves at intervals, and on death. There's supposed to be a story, but after 5 hours that involved 8 world restarts, I never got to see any of it.Most games of this genre let you customize the game world when you first start, including death rules and what not. Raft doesn't let you do that. Each difficulty has it's own set of rules. The Easy difficulty does allow you to keep your equipment on death, but it also downgrades all other aspects of the game too. I don't understand why they don't allow you to recover equipment on death; literally every other survival game like this allows it, in some way or another.I spent a whole day trying to enjoy Raft, but after countless forced resets, I just don't have the patience anymore. Definitely the most boring tedious survival game I've ever played. And I've played Dark & Light, so that's saying something.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 12 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiBasically, just an overgrown cellphone game. Very simple game play ideal for young adults.While I do not regret my purchase, I cannot recommend this game to survival enthusiasts.The game mechanics are just too simple. Essentially each activity in the game is an effort in time management with no real depth to each element. Oddly enough the game was more fun when it was simpler. The devs seem to be adding content from a textbook on how to create a game, and write things in just to write it in, and EXTREMELY slowly. Content updates come maybe once or twice a year with very poor communication.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 30 Haziran 2022Basically unplayable1. Food and drink consumption is unrealistically fast, and im a advent fan of survival but when your drinking water non stop something is wrong2. engines.....they cost 5 metal ingots. So they are a hell of a investment. Ergo you expect the devs to have coded them correctly. We had 2 just ""disappear"" in one session alone. Major bugs in a game that has been out for months and months is not a good look.3. The bruce shark mechanic is badly designed. If you play solo basically you have to leave the raft to be destroyed, and if you play with a friend you have to leave them behind, basically negating any multiplayer benefit. Why the shark has to attack you when your beached is beyond stupid.Not good, i would advice buying from a sale or skipping to next game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 17 Mart 2021Changing my review (original see below).  The Devs totally ruined this game with Chapter 3.  Tedious boss fights, non-sensical puzzles, and the worst platforming gauntlet that I've ever seen completely ruined what was otherwise a fun and relaxing game.  Its like the Devs are trying to please two diametrical crowds, with the result of ruining the fun for both of them.  Unless you're the type who enjoys going from a chill exploration/building/survival game to a frustrating repetition of stupid platforming challenges, I can no longer recommend this game.Original review:  I've really enjoyed this game so far (about 40 hours in).  I don't normally get Early Access games, but I took a chance on this one and so far I'm glad I did.It starts off a little slow, with not much direction in what to do (which isn't always a bad thing).  I died of thirst in my first few minutes of the first game, but figured it out after that.  There isn't much focus on combat, which I like, but the crafting, survival and exploration aspects of the game are really good.Looking forward to the third chapter.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 20 NisanThis game has been out. a while. so there are no more excuses at this point, the hitboxes are absolute donkey****, the shark is absolutely brutal for no reason, later on its nothing but just an annoyance as he'll shred your raft up chances are youll be too slow and he will usually break parts faster than you can find them leading to very slow game progression. as far as content goes, theres not that much. it WAS an amazing concept but horribly done",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 14 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis is a disappointing title. The opening hours of the game take an interesting premise and  run with it in an engaging manner and you strap yourself in for an interesting ride. Its a slow paced, chilled experience and hugely immersive as you contemplate your journey across an endless ocean with seemingly endless possibilities. But unfortunately this rapidly degenerates into a repetitive, linear and deeply disappointing experience with little to explore and even less to find. The recent additions to the game provide POI's that are decidedly underwhelming and further place the game on rails instead of expanding upon and deepening that which made the game initially fun, resulting in a game with zero replayability.Its a shame really. There is the kernel of a great game here and if the price of entry is worth about 20 hours of interesting content, then consider buying it, but the sense of disappointment, the direction of development, the missed opportunities and the lack of replayability tips it into the negative for me",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 20 Şubat 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is when you really need a meh recommendation. The game gets repetitive very quickly, even for early access. Float your boat, get flotsam, kill shark. Strangely killing the only threat in the game is actually easy - so easy that it is more annoyance than anything to be worried about. The small and large islands retain the ""seen-it-before"" mantra after you loot your third or fourth. There are a few ""special"" islands, but all revolve around jump and simplistic puzzles. Oh look, the bird has returned to peck away at my farm - better spear it to death again, and again, and again.The graphics are cutesy and simple, but the lack of character and design options means everyone and everything begins to look boring. However, I would not say I didn't get my money's worth from what little of the game currently exists, which is my reason for needing a meh option.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis poorly-made rip-off of Stranded Deep (Yes, I remember when you announced this and why) is designed strictly to klill you and remove whatever gains you made.  Float around and try to collect enough garbage to build and repair your raft that the ever-present Bruce eats.  Once you die, you lose everything you were carrying, forever.  Try to collect enough to replace it before you now starve or dehydrate, and lose it all again.  Usually happens right after you manage to learn how to make useful items.Good news!  You can open a world backup, since it autosaves every 10 minutes, or you can manually save.  This is pointless though.  You will start, in the water, dead.  You have exactly enough life to almost reach the surface, and Bruce will eat you if you do.Bought this on a 30% off sale, since that's all the discount this ever gets.  Absolutely was not worth it.(If you ONLY play with friends, this is almost worth it.  Your friends can collect you and throw you on a bed to revive you with your stuff.  It's often better to let yourself die and be revived than trying to keep up with the food and water.)",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 28 Mart 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiNot recommended at the moment. It's way too shallow and the story elements implemented so far are by far the worst parts of the game and actually clash with the rest of the experience.The game has a fun premise, but most of the systems are very boring and lackluster and there's generally very little to do.The only really positive thing in the game at the moment is that the building system is really well done. Everything just works and it's really fun. The system is streamlined and intuitive, but it's also very flexible. You can build some really interesting and imaginative rafts. It strikes the perfect balance between structure and fluidity in my opinion with the grid-based placing of structure elements while allowing you to freely rotate the objects on top to make your raft feel natural and fun to be on.I also really enjoyed how goofy the game is. You'll survive falling from extreme heights, you can build ridiculous looking and structurally unsound rafts and you can run around and bunny jump all over your raft with infinite stamina. Qualities rarely seen in survival games as they often take themselves way too seriously which in turn just end up hurting the entire experience because they're not able to do it properly anyway. The forest is a similar game which I really enjoyed solely because of how goofy it was. As with this game if that game had tried to be ""realistic"" it would have suffered instead.But apart from that the rest of the game is currently mediocre at best, and absolutely awful at its worst:Combat is some of the worst I've encountered in a game like this. It's completely bare bones and basic. All the enemies behave the same and all your weapons behave the same. And this game has the worst implemented bow of any game like it. Bows are usually really fun to use in games, but the bow in this game doesn't sound good to use, it doesn't feel good to use and the control scheme for it is unnecessarily awkward. Combat in general lacks weight, it lacks punch, it lacks excitement, it lacks variance, it sort of lacks everything at the moment. It feels like an alpha prototype.The food/drink system needs to be balanced to feel less like a constant chore. You're constantly drinking, constantly eating, constantly gathering more food and constantly gathering more water. It's an annoying chore that's just hanging over you throughout the entire game souring your experience.The day/night cycle has the same problem as the above as well. Days pass so fast you'll barely have the time to explore an island before it's night again, and nights seemingly last exactly as long as days, but there are no night specific activities so you'll just sleep through them, but after sleeping you always have to eat and drink which just makes the entire thing even more tedious.The high tempo is actually a problem in the game in general. Your tools will only last a few dozen uses and you'll often have to venture around with duplicates of your tools and weapons taking up space in your backpack just because you know they will break before you're done exploring an island.There's almost nothing fun to find or discover. Everything is just grinded and crafted and there are very few items in total. If you find a treasure chest (there are no actual treasure chests afaik, only boxes, which is almost a crime in a game about being stranded on a raft) there's never anything fun in it, just the same crafting components you'll grind anywhere else. Once in a while you'll hook a novel item while fishing, but that's it.There are no actual threats in the entire game. The shark is pathetic, the bears are pathetic, the survival element in general is pathetic.Metal and scrap are by far the low points of the current gather loop. The only way to get any amount of them is to scour the seafloor around islands, and this is by far the most tedious activity in the game. When you're starting to become self-sufficient on your raft for most of the other materials it really feels like you've accomplished something cool, but then you realize you'll still have to do the same menial chores you did when you first started out for the reminder of the game if you want to accomplish anything because everything requires metal and scrap.So much of the game feels static and ""gamey"" and clashes completely with the sandbox systems that are actually fun in the game like building your raft. This is by far the most prominent in the story elements of the game, which is why they are also by far the worst part of the game. You can't interact with anything in the story locations. This is a game design philosophy you would expect to see in a carefully crafted MMO where the developer wants 100% control over player progression, but it has absolutely no place in a goofy sandbox game. The same lack of interaction is also seen in the abandoned rafts you'll encounter at sea. They have only 2 states: Either they are floating with a box on them or you've taken the box and they'll sink. You're not able to interact with them in any other way. The fact that your only interaction with boxes and crates is to touch them and have them disappear and instantly give you their items also serve to highlight how static and ""gamey"" the game is at its worst times.At first you think this is a procedural sandbox, but it very quickly becomes clear that very little of the game is procedurally generated. You'll encounter the exact same abandoned rafts every single time and there are only a handful of different island variations so you'll see the exact same islands over and over. This game sorely needs more variation.Apparently there's a character limit for Steam reviews so I wasn't able to list my proposed solutions to the above issues here, but I'll write them on the forum and link that forum post here instead if that's possible. Just to show that I feel there's real potential for this game, it just isn't realized yet.Edit: My feedback post is here:https://steamcommunity.com/app/648800/discussions/2/2143091644387301124/",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Ağustos 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiYa know, I had a nice large review typed out, but steam went ""LOL nope!"" and it was all lost, despite hitting CTRL-C before trying to post.  SO thanks for that, Steam.Long story short  (I played on ""normal"" difficulty)Positives:1) Starting on a small raft, fighting against hunger, thirst, sharks, and supply deprivation really captures the struggle for survival in such conditions.  Very thematic and I like that.2) Getting out of that danger zone by expanding your raft, building purifiers, grills, etc and telling mother nature where to stick it is a good feeling.Negatives:1) Shark attacks are incessant.  Every few minutes you have to deal with this.  And if you kill the shark?  It's only a few extra minute reprieve before it respawns.1a)  At least you can tell the shark off by reinforcing your foundation with armor.  (reinforce foundation beneath things such as storage chests and valuable items such as engines first)2) Seagulls.   Attack your crops incessantly.  More annoying than the shark in that regard.  You can't do anything about them.   Scarecrows?  They'll be attacked by the seagulls instead until broken, and then they'll attack your crops anyhow.   This is IF the scarecrows work at all because there is a bug where the seagulls can ignore them entirely.  Scarecrows are ablative armor for your crops at best, and not very good at that.Did you let your crops grow (flowers in my case), and then encase them entirely in a building on your raft? With four full walls, roof, and floor?  Doesn't matter.  Seagulls will fly right through them.   The amount of irritation and annoyance seagulls cause cannot be overstated.  The fact you can't even encase your crops to protect them makes it all as well.3) Hunger and Thirst.    I don't mind these kind of mechanics, really.  I DO mind how they've been implemented.   There is a danger zone on the meters where once you cross it, you are instantly and severely slowed down.  The only indicator of this is a mark on the bars themselves.   Pray you're not in the water when either of these hit.What would need to change for me to recommend:1)Fix the bugs!2)Lower the frequency of Shark and Seagull attacks... and stop seagulls from being able to fly through buildings.3)Alter how Thirst and Hunger work.   Currently, Hunger has a stomach growling sound and Thirst had a dry cough sound, both of which only begin AFTER you enter the danger zone.   Those sounds should begin before you enter that danger zone.4) Make it feel less grindy.Things I would like to see: The ability to change your world's difficulty setting after creation. (except on Hardcore, one-life-only game modes, should that ever be implemented).There is a TON of potential here, and the early game is very fun.  But the late game just doesn't keep you drawn to it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 NisanAfter a good long play of this game and finally finished the main story, I was left feeling disappointed, like, enjoying that delicious pizza only to be left with a bad taste that makes me contemplate my life choices.I will say, Raft is a pretty cool game, indeed with an interesting concept which allows you to build a raft out of endless supply of floating plastic and wood.... and palm leaves.... and the odd barrel or two... honestly where has all this garbage come from?Story progression is handed to you nice and simple, first obtaining the Receiver, using such device allows you to begin your journey, which you collect posted notes to find the next story location #1337Gathering resources is simple enough, but one of many arguments I have is that you need to use a FREAKING hook just to collect that stone from the sea floor, I get for items like Copper & iron, that's fine, but stones and scrap which appear loose, unacceptable.Whiles I'm on topic of being unacceptable, here are things that really need improving!* Batch Crafting: clicking multiple times not only is it tiring, but you are wearing down the button.* Hold <Keybind>: I'm sick and tired of repeatedly pressing E to stuff my unwanted items into the recycler.* Durability: Its really bad, things don't even last long before breaking too quickly, like sheers, fishing rod, oxygen bottle, flippers, etc.* Item Recoverables: Bowls, Juicer jugs, those kinds of things, you consume the contents, not freaking eating clay bowls and glass jars* Recipes: Most recipes require a LOT of titanium, and I mean A LOT, finding it is by chance via metal detector, some locations which you can find isn't much, and the best method in getting it is buying it from island shops, even then you need to SCRAP and FISH to get those scrap cubes and trade coins to do so, and repeated E's on the recycler is bad enough trying to scrap so little titanium, to craft ONE FREAKING Advanced Net.... and it costs 4 titanium for one net, and its damn right thievery.Overall, I do enjoy the mechanics and game play, and its fun with a few friends too, but.... this game seriously needs some QoL content, I mean a lot.As for end game?, I complain about this a lot in most games, you finally get those high gear items, but for what?, the story is over, the quest is complete, there is nothing left to do, besides finding those missing notes, killing a mama bear, or achievement hunting, but that's about it, It would be nice in getting some post game quests, or something to further expand on the game, to keep it fresh and interesting, once the story is done, the game is done.I just hope the devs do DLC or free content updates, for now, guess I'll turn my attention to mods.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 11 MayısRaft is a game that starts out slow and painful, starts to feel fun as you get on your feet, and then nosedives into tedium.The beginning of the game is probably the most difficult part of the entire game because you start with basically nothing and have to fight an uphill battle to gather enough resources to prevent yourself from dying to hunger or thirst. It's somewhat difficult but fair and when you finally get some basic stuff fleshed out on your raft and come to grips with the general mechanics of the game it feels quite rewarding to overcome the initial challenges.After you overcome the hurdle of simply being able to survive you will find that hunger and thirst entirely become background noise and very rapidly transform from feeling rewarding to conquer to being tedious and annoying. There are powerful recipes that you can discover that help reduce the frequency that you have to deal with hunger/thirst but simple recipes are immediately available and since items can stack high enough there is little need to have an item that replenishes 80% of your hunger when you can have a stack of 5 items that each replenish 40%. The only reason to use items that replenish any significant amount of the bars is to save on inventory space when exploring story locations. Whenever you are on your raft you will have access to essentially infinite supplies and any non-story island is quick enough to explore that you can always get by with the lowest tier foods or in the worst case scenario just need to make a quick return to your boat; which generally you will end up doing from time to time anyway if you try to harvest everything on the island (due to limited inventory space).The other major threat in the game is enemy creatures of which there are two main types. The first is enemies you may encounter on islands or story areas. They have very rudimentary attack patterns and are generally very easy to deal with whether that means fighting or ignoring them entirely. The second threat is the shark ""Bruce"". The shark follows your raft forever and will aggro you any time you specifically if you enter the water near it. If you remain on your raft he will periodically eat pieces of it. Bruce eating your raft is very infrequent and you have two options of dealing with it. You can either attack him to get him to stop which usually means preventing the destruction of that raft piece (you will need to repair it) or you can ignore him and let him finish eating it. Choosing to ignore the shark attack might seem like something you would want to avoid but in reality the cost of building a new raft piece is barely more than that of repairing a piece and by the time you get past the very start of the game the required materials are extremely trivial to come by. So generally you can just periodically build some dummy pieces along the outside of your raft so that no useful areas are destroyed (he only attacks the outer most pieces) and then completely ignore him. If you enter the water you will have to contend with Bruce attacking you yourself which will come up in 2 major scenarios. Scenario 1: You want to kill Bruce. Fighting the shark is a timing game where you swim at each other and press attack at the right time. Doing so and landing the hit will prevent him from getting any damage on you. You then repeat this 10+ times depending on your weapon. Then he dies and you get some mid tier food from his corpse and get the luxury of him not bothering you for a few minutes. He will respawn though, which makes him an infinite source of mid tier food although bird nests are far less time consuming if that is your goal. Scenario 2: You want to explore/gather an island/reef/location. Because Bruce will always revert to following your raft, you can anchor your raft just a little bit away from the destination and then jump off and swim to it. If you get on land he will get bored and go back to your raft and remain there, allowing you to do whatever you want at the location and completely ignore him. If you don't want him to follow you on your initial jump into the water you can use shark bait to keep him busy for a minute but I used the shark bait zero times and had no trouble. If you want to prevent him from biting you, you can just attack him to prevent all damage, and you should only need to do this a couple times at max to reach a safe enough distance for him to go back to your raft. So basically you can ignore needing to do Scenario 1 because there are better sources of food and he respawns anyway, and you can almost completely ignore the shark in Scenario 2 because he will just leave you alone if you keep your distance. In short, the enemies are tedious and/or annoying.The objective of the game is to advance through a series of ""story"" islands/locations. The loop for locations is to wander around until you find key items by chance and then wander around until you find a spot to use them. Sometimes you will need to remember where you saw a door that needed a green key now that you wandered around and encountered the green key, other times you just pick stuff up and keep going to places you haven't tried going to yet. Sometimes there are enemies that you have to fight but they are, as described, very easy to deal with. Some of the locations take a decent amount of time to explore so you will need to bring some extra food/water if you don't want to make a few return trips to your raft. It is unnecessary to use anything better than the first food items you encounter in the game though doing so does decrease the tedium of dealing with your meters slightly. There is a story that you uncover in the game but I didn't find it terribly interesting. Certainly better than nothing but I never felt driven to find out what happens, though that may just be me.So that's pretty much it. Building and designing your raft can be kind of fun if you are into that sort of thing but there are effectively zero major threats to contend with once you get past the very start. There is no need to think critically about how to build your raft because there are no threats to its safety and no problem that can't be overcome by just building more raft, farm plots, or whatever. There is almost never a need to utilize skill because almost all the enemies are easy to deal with or can be ignored entirely. Gathering resources on islands is repetitive and tedious. Story location exploration is repetitive and mundane and sometimes requires grating backtracking. The ""survival"" part of the game is annoying background noise. The ""crafting part of the game is okay if you are into base building type stuff. The shark is at best annoying and at worst completely irrelevant.I would only recommend this game if you are very into base building and also really, really like large empty oceans. It may also be an option if you want something to zone out and ""chill"" with, because you could just sit on your raft and fish all day if you are into that sort of thing. But IMO there are better, even free to play games, that offer ""base building"" or ""chilling"", so even if you do fall into those niche categories I would have a hard time recommending Raft.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 29 MartThe core of the game is neat, but as with the majority of the open world sandbox survival genre it falls short in very many aspects. Tons of QoL features missing, lots of unnecessary grinding required due to the ""scarcity"" the game forces by causing some items such as bowls and jars to be consumed on use and trees not having 100% return on seeds, and very unbalanced fuel requirements which only gets worse when you get engines.

"Yayınlanma: 29 Temmuz 2022I picked up Raft during the 2022 Summer Sale.  It was picked up for coop gaming.Only consider picking it up if you're getting it for coop gaming.Early AccessThe game was in early access on Steam from May 2018 to June 2022.  During this time, I had heard of it but wasn’t following it in any way.The Good, the Bad and the Middle GroundGoodRaft building – straightforward and easy to do, minus the required resourcesRaft decoration – a decent number of options that can beautify the raft when resources permitCoop – coop doesn’t have any bugs except for some lag when first connecting, very easy to join a friend’s gameMiddle GroundIsland exploration and diving – can be fun to explore the nooks and crannies of the islands and the undersea areas, but once you see the limited number of island variations it gets old fastInventory management/size – very limited inventory size that slowly expands as you learn to make bigger backpacks, still very limited with the largest backpackStory – isn’t great, but enjoyable enough for a single playthroughBadTutorial – no tutorial about anythingIsland variation – there is a very limited number of islands, once you see one it will repeat fairly often, each biome has a set of islandsIsland size – beyond the story islands, the islands aren’t bigShark – the shark is immediately around the raft when the game first loads and will start attacking you and the raft, the shark can destroy the raft before you make it to the first islandCritters – some of the hostile wildlife is an absolute pain to deal with, a good number are also large damage spongesResource gathering – resource gathering can be slow, often quite small quantities, late game resources are very limitedUnharvestable resources – all the medium to big islands will have trees that can’t be harvested, there might be a couple harvestable trees among all the unharvestable ones, not worth the time to check all of themResource grind – to unlock certain things you have to travel to certain biome islands, those islands may only have 1-2 resources of what you need when you need a lot more than thatBoss fights – more about avoiding damage and dealing damage to a very spongey bossSurvival – the food and water deplete quite fast even in the lighter survival modesTool and gear wear – tools and gear wear out fastSecond raft or rebuilding – once the shark destroys all the raft floats/foundations it can’t be rebuilt, can’t build a second raftReplayability – no replayability, story is not worth a second playthrough and the survival loop wouldn’t be interesting enough for a second playthrough, limited island variation means you’d be revisiting all the places you have already seen multiple times over alreadyRare encounters and items – beyond rare, only saw 1-2 small ones over the course of playingGame ModesThe game has 5 game modes.PeacefulEasyNormalHardCreativeFor a full description on game modes, seehttps://raft.fandom.com/wiki/Game_ModesPlaytimeWith two players, it took about 40 hours, not in a rush, to get through and complete the story.RecommendationAs a coop game, I’d recommend it if you’re looking for a survival game that has a light story which offers an ending to the game.  Playing coop makes the experience better and you have someone to help with all the survival and combat tasks.  As a solo game, I’d avoid it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Şubat 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is a charming and beautiful survival game which starts off strongly.However, even if collecting junk and crafting always are fun to begin with, they quickly become boring when you need to keep manually crafting the same stuff throughout the whole game. There need to be a progression, not just in how many advanced things you can craft, but also in that you don't have to manually craft the basic stuff later in the game. Stuff like farming and water purification really needs to be able to be automated, since it isn't fun forever.Me and my friends needed about 10 hours to reach the end of the story (so far), and sadly I must say I was bored already after 5.

"Yayınlanma: 1 Eylül 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI have to say the game is a disappointment.It isn't complete.   You are left hanging after the first chapter, further chapters requiring an ""update"".Then there is the problem that the game is not even a proper ""open universe"".    After ""completing"" that first chapter you may want to go back and do some things that you didn't do because you were focused on ""Getting to Balboa"".Problem is that a large chunk of the game is removed after completing Balboa.  Bad enough the next chapter isn't out yer, (Oh boy if I have to pay money for it I am just done.), but say you didn't see the need for domesticated animals your first time through.  Well after Balboa is complete you are SOL, not of the animals you'd seen earlier are to be found again.  No Lamas, no goats, no puffer fish, (why you don't need a net to catch what isn't in the game any more), No giant clams to build birds nest with.  Thus, if you didn't ""do"" birds you will never get a hammock without restarting the game from scratch.Why do such a frustrating thing?

"Yayınlanma: 11 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt may be petty but I'm giving a negative review as I just encountered a serious gamebreaker. While Raft overall is a nice concept and can provide hours of fun for single- and multiplayer there are a few problems that can annoy you to the point of uninstalling the game.So I had just spent a few hours solo, building a nice little raft and progressing along. I came upon an island, and since I only could use the basic anchor I use one of those, going ashore to collect some resources. Just as I had set foot on land I noticed the shark attacking my raft, but didnt think much of it.... until a minute later I noticed my raft was gone. Gone, as in out of sight, as at that moment rather bad weather hit as well.What happened? The shark decided to chew out the ONE tile of my raft that held my anchor... and when he destroyed it, my raft happily went on its way without me. Due to bad weather, I can't see where to it is headed. And due to the developers being morons I can't build a new raft despite having enough materials on me, as the building system in this game requires you to have at least one tile of your initial raft available to build anything.My options now?

"Yayınlanma: 17 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiHalf the basic functions are broken. I frequently cannot cook because it will not let me add planks (and yes, I have them in inventory), then when it does let me add planks and the item cooks I can't remove the fish afterward for no reason despite half my inventory being empty. Half the time I try to hook something, the hook phases through the object when I try to pull it back. The hook gets stuck on the ground if you accidentally throw it not into the water, and you have to jump into the water to debug it. Inconvenient on an island. I've also seen the shark magically flying during times of larger waves. Add to the fact, the pause menu worked about 3 times before it decided it was never going to pause again. There's a long list here and keeps getting added to the longer I play.This was $20 bucks? Seriously? Nah I'm pissed. This game functioned better when it was free. Now things are weirdly organized, processes don't make sense (who needs to research making a NET? why is that a thing when it was in the OG game without research?), and things break all the time with no way to fix them. I've closed the game, restarted my computer, blah blah. If I can't do the basic survival functions, I can't play the game. This should not be $20. $15, MAYBE.

"Yayınlanma: 24 Şubat 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiLet me make it clear for the people that are still thinking whether or not to get this game.Straight off the bat, if you think this is a survival game. DONT BUY IT.There is no surviving involved. Once you get past the learning curve(AKA learn how to get food and build) You will wonder. Whats next? The next is one of these 3 options:1. You explore the endless ocean, only to find islands with the same resourses as before and make new items such as an upgraded spear2. You start completing the story, but find out that its frustratingly boring and involves you just traveling to a spot, getting a thing and then going to another spot. You get bored and either complete the game. Or just leave it3. Screw story and exploring right? You decide that Surviving is fun in this game. So 2 hours in the game you build a nice little raft with a kitchen and a garden. Whats next? Nothing. Getting water & food in this game is the easiest thing to do and isnt fun at all.SummaryExploration - 3/10Story 3/10Surviving - 1/10If you like games that involve stories that just make you go from one place to another - buy it.You wont stumble across ANYTHING new. Unless you place story mode. Which is boring.But one good thing that is in this game is building the actual raft. It is actually fun to customize your raft.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 31 Mart 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhether you like a game or not often has a lot to do with how you get into it. And „Raft“ gave me quite a horrible start!The biggest problem is the shark. There are sea monsters in Subnautica, too, but you can get out of their way. Not so with the shark in „Raft“. It is there. Always.Shortly after you enter the water, you will get bitten for the first time. Then there will be a bite every few seconds.You can take three (or even four?) bites before you die, so basically you can’t enter the water.The second problem is the grinding. You start with a plastic hook and you have to gather floatsome out of the water, that you need to craft stuff.That is one annoying task, throwing your hook, pulling it back, hundreds of times, for every little piece of scrap.There are a couple of things you need to craft at the start and you don’t have much time for that. You need to provide yourself with food and freshwater, you need a new plastic hook, because the one you have will eventually break and you have to repair your raft, because that shark bites off pieces every few minutes.And that is all you do, at least in the first hour. Hurry up gathering stuff/crafting and avoiding the shark to survive. And that is only to keep the status quo.There is no room for exploration, neither underwater, nor on the islands you drift on by, because you can’t really leave your raft. If you do, and your raft floats away, the island will disappear at one point and you are back in the water with the shark. Good luck swimming back to the raft.First I tried „normal“ difficulty (as described by the game as „normal mode for the normal player“ - seriously?) then on „easy“. Didn’t feel much of a difference.Now I know, there is also a „creative“ mode with no enemies and no pressure, but that is not what I want either. I want a bit of challenge, but not in such an annoying and grindy way.After about an hour of grinding and dying, I decided that „Raft“ is no fun for me and asked for a refund.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 19 Haziran 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiFirst impressions of this game were not great. The graphics were dull and uninspired, the water looked like something out of Half Life 1 and with two characters to choose from you really start to see where the 'Early Access' tag comes into play. However the gameplay is very interesting, although a little slow. You throw out a line to pull objects in that you will use to craft more pieces of your raft and things like beds, camp fires, etc etc. A shark is swimming around you, slowly chipping away at your raft until there's nothing left. However this is where the good idea ends, and the poor execution begins. On the hardest difficulty the Shark attacks VERY infrequently, to the point of you realizing that the only thing to fear is running out of food and water, and not so much the menace of the ocean circling the raft.I really wish they'd add a smart, more unpredictable shark to the game that REALLY gives you a challenge. Even multiple sharks the further you progress, dictated by either spending lots of time on  the raft or upgrading past a certain point. Either way, a very interesting and novel idea among a pile of same old same old 2D spirte indies and cheap shooters.  Give this one a try if you're interested and bring a friend, as there's nobody really playing it. My friend and I enjoyed our time, however the game cake just isn't ready to come out of the oven yet, so for however delicious it's beginning to smell I had to refund it for now.

"Yayınlanma: 8 OcakI hated it, loved it then hated it way more. Why? because they had one member of the team that has only one job, make the game not fun. How did he manage to do that? let's see..1 - Do we have a story or not?The story is the weirdest part ever. when you start you don't even know if there's a story and then it keeps evolving and evolving into something that's way far from survival game. You go to places that has no connection to each other. you feel like the story is a filler but at some point you will have to play the story to discover new things.2 - Zero clarityYour tasks are always difficult to understand. when you finally understand them, you'll feel like the game mechanics are so limited. For example (Spoiler ahead) the final boss was a poisonous huge dog or something. you need to hit it like 30+ plus hits to kill it, but you can only hit its face. Good luck doing that with your slash.. yeah you can only slash with your weapon3 - Is this fun? yes? sorry you can't do it.So you found a nice jetski. Can I ride it? OMG I CAN. you have fun with it. You're so happy and now you wanna take it and keep it on your raft as a trophy. NOPE you can't put it on your raft sorry because we can't let you have too much fun.4 - Unreasonable difficulty of silly things.You wanna catch a goat? You need to go to specific part of the ocean, kill a bufferfish WHICH IS SO DAMN HARD to kill without it exploding on your face and killing you. you do that to get 'explosive powder' ???? why do I have to do all of that? it's not even logical----------------------------------------------------------I had fun playing it with my fiance. building stuff and being goofy and stupid. We even enjoyed bugs sometimes even tho some of them are so frustrating sometimes.I would recommend this game only if you played all survival games and this is the only one left to play. Play it with someone, Don't take it seriously at all, and if you got frustrated by something through the story just seek help online or try mods. Don't worry it won't ruin your experience because the story was made by the laziest person ever.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 21 Kasım 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt's a neat idea, but the game requires far too much constant grinding of collecting materials to do much of anything. Maybe this is improved by having more than two people on a raft doing constant collection and maintenance (because the shark eats the raft almost as fast as you can repair it) and also collecting and refining fresh water, growing crops, etc.It's all just too much grinding and maintenance to be any fun. Requesting a refund for myself and my son. We had hoped to play this together but we both got very frustrated with it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 31 Aralık 2021Well after some time the publisher has chosen to finish this game along with what very little of a plot, story, campaign whatever you want to call it which I will not spoil here but I will say does nothing to explain how you started on a 4 square raft with nothing in sight so no idea what community you were scouting for and has an ending that is so anticlimactic it was literally the worst ending they could have chosen possible. The zetans aliens in Fallout 3's DLC made waaaay more sense then the ending in this game.Last thing I will say is the game started as an exploration/crafting experience which had some combat which you could even skip entirely by playing in peaceful mode, that is until the giant floating see-thru golf ball gets involved then the game loses everything it had been up to that point and becomes nothing more then obscure puzzles and combat.So if you chose to go the peaceful route, your screwed, if you got the game for what it was before, crafting and exploring, your screwed, if you bought this game thinking its a combat game, your screwed and if you bought this game for puzzles, your screwed.",N/A

Shark bites the raft and magically everything on that raft tile goes into the void as if you have never build anything. It has already been 2 years after launch and you still call it a betta.

Stuttering characters, delayed movements. latency issues with only 50-70 ping?

"Yayınlanma: 21 Temmuz 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game has a lot of POTENTIAL, but falls short in it's current state.  For fellow members of the online gaming world, think of it as this....a constant grind for materials, but with no real reward other than a larger piece of wood to float around on.  The constant presence of the shark eating your raft is annoying to say the least, and I feel like it was added just to give you something to do besides collect building materials.  It is neither relaxing or rewarding to play in my opinion.  Again...it has potential, but unless the developers create more content and give you longer breaks from a lame version of jaws that apparently can't get enough of eating driftwood...don't waste your money.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiI really loved the original demo. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game in its current version - I've played it for, as you can see, 1.2 hours so far, and I have yet to survive far enough to plant a single crop or erect a single structure. One of the things that makes this so frustrating is the way that  . . .* Dying leaves you significantly worse off than you started the game. When you die, you respawn without the hook which you use to collect materials. To get a new hook, you have to collect materials . . . which is very difficult without a hook. Objects have a pretty small hitbox and your character has a pretty short reach, making it difficult to collect materials by hand without getting into the water. And getting into the water is a problem because . . .* Getting out of the water is a struggle. In the original demo, your movement was effectively restricted to two dimensions, meaning you couldn't really sink BELOW the raft. In this game, it seems as if the moment you leave the raft, you sink under, and your character seems to struggle to keep their head above water. Who is this bad at swimming? And once you go under water, your vision is obscured, often making it difficult even to figure out which direction the raft is in. Once you find the raft, you often slide up and down pointlessly against the edge or slide under it while you're trying to jump up on it. While this is happening, a shark is biting your legs, encouraging you to hurry up and thus increasing your chances of screwing up the jump repeatedly. This isn't something that should be difficult.* Islands. I was excited to try out the island exploration feature! Unfortunately, what I didn't realize is that when you climb onto an island . . . your raft keeps going. Without you. And you're pretty much screwed at that point; I restarted the game. Of course, you can avoid this (I assume) by crafting a Raft Anchor . . . but there was no way for me to know that BEFORE I climbed onto the island and crossed the rubicon.* I couldn't collect resources fast enough to survive. Once I figured that such features as ""island exploration,"" ""swimming,"" and ""respawning"" were all traps rather than viable options, I avoided them at all costs, instead focusing solely on collecting materials and getting a grill and water purifier as fast as possible. The first time I tried this, I decided to build the water purifier first . . . only to have a shark IMMEDIATELY eat the part of the my raft I'd put it on. I had no way to stop this, since I hadn't had time to craft a spear, and once the purifier was gone, I didn't have time to build another one before I died of dehydration. The second time, I managed to build a purifier, avoid it being eaten by a shark, get fresh water, build a grill, grill a potato, eat it . . . only to die of hunger shortly afterwards, because it provided very little nutrients and I wasn't able to find and cook another food item before I died.This was approximately the point where I quit to write this review. What it comes down to is that I'm just not having any fun in this version of the game.",N/A

The typical exploration of other survival titles is stripped away and the bulk of the time is spent just standing around on the raft while waiting for resources to generate in the waters infront of it. Any departure from the exact wind direction to visit an island is punished by stopping the resource generation.Exploring the seconds story location was probably the high point of the game, but due to the setting i dont really see there being many more moments like that even futher in the developtment.It's been early access for 2 years and it still feels like a mess.

"Yayınlanma: 22 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game has too many positive reviews that I'm gonna make one negative one, because it deserves it.If you want to make one nice raft, then it could be good for you to show your creative side. Which is ok way to keep you interested.But if you want exploration and survival aspect of these kind of games, you'll get disappointed.There is no challenge, only challenge you get is first 10-15 minutes until you craft basic tools, islands are all pretty much the same, animals are underwhelming and have no AI at all in them, shark is annoying and just attacks you on sight, ironically even with bad mechanic like that it poses no threat as your HP regenerates almost instantly once you are out of water, and there is no reason to be in water really..Water animation is underwhelming too, once you break surface of water its just dark, there's no color at all, like you are in space or something.Underwater is areas seem pretty at first but are small few meter areas around islands and sole purpose of them is to hide few abundant resources that you can find on any other island, they don't add anything to exploration aspect. Just throw shark bait and dive few minutes to collect resources and that's it.Surviving is just a chore, there is absolutely no way of you getting low on food or water at all, it's just a chore to even eat/Drink - cook/purify. if you survive those first 15 minutes, and only way to not survive them is if you play first time and you are completely clueless of what to do.This game at this state is just dumbed down so much, what's the point really. It's cool idea, you are on raft and you need to survive and expand your raft. But all ideas around the raft are just, not nothing, but basically pointless.Islands have limited designs and most of them are explore-able in 30 seconds or less, they contain same resources (few palms, watermelons), few animals if you lucky and that's all the exploration you'll get.Collecting resources is also pointless, once you get Net collectors, you'll get so much resources while doing nothing, it's gonna be a chore just to sort them.Anyhow, I did play this game for some time now, expecting to see something unexpected, but it's just not coming, and yea, I'll probably play a bit more to realize my raft idea, but this game does deserve negative review. It's not nearly as good as 95% positive reviews suggest, there is almost no meaningful content other than raft building.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 24 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiI have tested out the game for a few hours. And in it's current state I would not recommend buying it.Here is why.The game is in an alpha state, which means a lot of things are still missing.It is extremely repititive. Shark attacks every 5 minutes like clockwork. You need to make and drink water every 2 minutes. Same goes for food. The frustration starts to take over quickly and not in a good way.The crafting system is alright, but there are some balance issues. Some recources are hard to come by which extends the game for a long time. Also, all your crafting items wear out pretty quickly and a lot of them consume quite a lot of resources which makes this game a near endless grindfest without much progression.The optimization of the game is bad to say the least. but this is an early access title, just be aware of it that it might not run as smoothly as you think.The game still needs a lot of work but has the potentional to become a great indie game.

"Yayınlanma: 24 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiLet me just say, this game has a good idea to it, but doesn't make any sense in quite a few ways.- A friend and I just started and saw an island so we went to the island and then our raft went on without us (of course we didnt have an anchor), we just assumed we could remake one with the trees and stuff on that island. We got a ton of wood and stuff and then realized all the items in the water were gone I was then in the crafting area to try and figure out how to make another raft and BAM the entire island disappeared. So after that we swam to a rock we saw in the distance sticking out of the ground to figure out why the island disappeared, so I looked at the game page and couldn't find out why, then BAM  the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rocks disappear. At this point we assume you HAVE to stay on the raft and can only use that raft for the entire game, which is sorta annoying- The game itself is good quality and stuff but overall is extremly boring litterally just surviving on a raft all game with nothing special.- It is not worth $20 I'd say a solid $10 is what it should be worth, if not less.That is all, hate all you want it is how I feel and my honest opinion on it.

"Yayınlanma: 11 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI'm only giving a negative review on this so the devs might notice this MAJOR Q.o.L. issue.So I was trying to remove a door. Well, I guess I was removing a wall. No big deal right? Just replace it.. Yeahhh.. All my food chests were attached to the wall. So 2 fully loaded chests just disappeared. There is no mechanics for chests t odrop their loot upon destruction.. And if you break a tile that is holding something else the object on the broken tile WILL DISAPPEAR. Sooo Yeah. Not cool..Sure we can catch a chest full of fish again and get our 60+ of each fruit back. But that was a serious ""do I really want to play this knowing I could lose so much progress?""UPDATE LOLSo about an hour later I decided I'd lower my graphic settings to get some better FPS.. Well, suddenly my raft was standing vertically and several feet off the surface of the water.. To which it got worse and worse until my raft was flying through the ground and the ocean disappeared. So I exited and re entered and now my raft is permanently stuck inside the island I was anchored next to.",N/A

But after 8 hours it gets boring, after a while, you are just sitting on a raft, hoping to see an island or another raft to get supplys from. All im saying is its NOT AT ALL worth 20$.

"Yayınlanma: 8 Şubat 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiRather than advance the game and make it better they've just increased the difficulty to excruciating levels. Solo play is boring, the resources required to survive is too high.Creative aside there's no end-game so even if you do manage to create some of the later stage equipment there's no story to progress, nothing to keep you playing. For the money I spent on this game there are games with much more content that are being updated as a passion project and doing their players a service. This is a hype game which probably saw some streamer popularity and made the devs rich .. why continue making content when they can reap the benefits from good reviews and virality.The concept was good but it's fun for a day or two and then there's really no point.When people say it's 'fun with friends' What they really mean is their friends are fun and this is a small sandbox environment to experience together but as far as longevity of the title, don't expect your money to go far with this game.I could've played the 2 hours of steam time before refunding and still feel satisfied I'd experienced all it had to offer.",N/A

The shark is simple to bait and kill and getting enough materials to finally reach end game takes no more than 2-3 hours.Once we reached the end game it was a joke, and there was actually nothing to do except build what you need to get to the ""final"" part of the game. Reach that and it really felt as though you did everything for nothing.I will say the first hour was amazing! It felt fresh and new, and the music was gorgeous and everything seemed so fun.

"Yayınlanma: 10 Kasım 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThere's just too many design choices that ruin the game early on. The extremely high cost of anchors, for example, severely limits your ability to explore, lest your raft float away and you die (because for some inexplicable reason, you can't build a new raft). The anchor you get when you do invest is literally a one time use item, you anchor once and it's gone. Poof! Magic took it away.Meanwhile, you'll be tossing your hook at everything that floats, with no time to relax lest you run out of the things you need to survive. While you might expect this in a survival game of course, it is jarringly in contrast to the feel of the game, where you're floating on the ocean and just want to chill. at least occasionally. Perhaps, after 5 hours of work, you might get to relax. Early on, at least, it is stressful simply because you can't afford to miss the debris floating by. Hence, you're sentenced to hooking for nearly the entire time, and while fun at first, very quickly loses its charm after the 100th time--and that 100th time comes within the first hour.Lastly, the technology progression through the research station is likewise deeply problematic. You can't research on your own, you have to fish up or find schematics randomly for random things, which again sounds like a survival game. In this case though, there are absolutely core technologies needed to do things, like a permanent anchor, which you can't get except through luck. I normally love a random loot system like this, but you can't make basic essentials randomly obtained. How do you not have an anchor as the most basic necessity in a raft survival game? It's not like not being able to control the direction you're going--oh wait, you can't do that either without creating a sail and paddle. It's things like that that kill the game for me, particularly because the costs for all these things are very high. This leads you to hooking everything in sight, which becomes 90% of the game. The other 10% is fiddling with the things you want to make or have made, or exploring in very brief windows.Perhaps once you reach  the later game, things are different. Yet the obstacles raised to getting there  are just too much. There's too many fundamental design choices that are simply wrong, and while the slightest tweak could fix it, I don't anticipate them doing so as they are core design choices.  For example, when you start the game, you're simply dropped in the middle of the sea on a raft with no explanation or tutorial whatsoever. This is extraordinarily alienating when you don't know how to play the game. It's the type of game you have to learn on youtube or whatever first, but needlessly so. They could have made a 3 minute tutorial or even just had some helpful guidance messages, like ""start hooking materials with your hook!"" but they decided, meh, let's drop them in without saying anything. Some people might like that. I'm not one of them.In this shark tank, there are key design choices that are ruinous. The gameplay isn't very rewarding, as when you are rewarded, it's often because you used your hook for the 500th time. You can't just appreciate things, there's simply no time to. It's unfortunate, but for all these reasons and more, I'm out.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 20226/10 ""Sailing in shallow waters.""I've always looked at Raft as a game without a lot of actual depth because the core loop is to maintain yourself and your raft. As such, I've waited until the very full release to play the game, but the additional content does not expand upon the main loop beyond giving you additional goals to progress towards.Diving in relatively blind, it took me two failed runs to quickly understand what's required to achieve a self-sustaining raft. After that point, there is not much else to do except to resupply each station, reel in the occasional barrel, and start sailing towards the story objectives. The constant tool degradation and upkeep required to maintain the raft can get very tedious until the raft reaches a larger size and with some much needed automation installed onto it.The shark threat was initially an exciting element... until it wasn't. I would say I'm not good with nopes in general, but I'm the type to eventually get used to it. For example, I get bored enough to try fighting the Reaper leviathan in Subnautica and come out on top. I've given myself some good ol' thalassophobia by delving into many such games over the years and experiencing the horrors of the deep. I imagine this element may remain exciting to others... but for me, once the initial scare/excitement wore off, all that remained was the constant grind (until automation, at which point there is not much else to do).But what about the exploration aspect of the game? It's definitely there, but the game does not typically reward the player for it. I feel that most random islands are generally a waste of your time, and so there is not much to explore beyond the islands tied to story progression.I would recommend Raft if you are an absolute spineless coward as the shark element should keep the game exciting for you. For anyone else, it's simply an average game with nothing else to do once you progress to a certain point. It may not seem fair, but land-based survival games are limited by the amount of land available times your own creativity. Here, it's just you, your raft, and the ocean. The narrowed focus does deliver a good experience... the first few times around.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is a waste of $20. You would be better off buying something nearly anything else. Raft is a very very bare-bones survival game where they only thing you really need to worry about is a shark.

The graphic is okay, but I found the biggest problem to be how little you could build when exploring in creative.The only good thing at the moment is the crafting part, it is a fun expericence to research in to what you can craft and make a nice place out of the raft with some grills and other cool thing.So again it is for me a bad game because there is very little building blocks to work with and a lot of limits to what you can build if the current state of the game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 21 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiIf you like spending hours drifting at sea picking up garbage, then it's the game for you. Don't listen to anyone telling you there's a story, as if though that somehow makes it more interesting or engaging. The ""story"" doesn't add any depth to the game, is very short and ends abruptly since it's not even finished. You never encounter any human NPCs and just pick up notes they left behind which doesn't add up to much for a ""story"" at all.The enemies you're introduced to while trying to solve the mystery end up exposing how poor the game is, and they are only briefly terrifying before becoming minor nuisances at best once you learn how to sidestep or walk backwards to avoid suffering any injury. Unlike other games which require you to research & craft to progress, for some reason you start the game capable of growing plants on the raft, yet can't obtain Dirt without a special tool in a special location (you don't use dirt in the crop planter recipes but it's obvious there's dirt being used, so having Dirt as a separate item is just confusing). Also several items are used for only one recipe. Overall: 6/10, not worth $20, wait for it to go on sale for $5BUT, as I said in the beginning, if you like to drift out at sea mindlessly collecting garbage, then look no further since this is a fairly good simulator for that.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiAfter playing this game for 35 minutes and trying twice to play with a friend, it was apparent that the game is fundamentally broken. Every time me and my friend would find an island, we would run around on it for 10 minutes and the entire island would disappear and leave us in an empty ocean of nothing with no way to build another raft. YOU CANT BUILD WITHOUT YOUR ORIGINAL RAFT. I can not understand how this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews in such a broken state? If these are gameplay mechanics, wtf were the devs thinking.

"Yayınlanma: 6 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiInteresting concept; however I had 2 major issues with the game.  First it has no built-in tutorial on which keys/button clicks do what.  Through trial and error (i.e. lots of dieing or getting eaten by sharks) one figures out the key pressess.  Second, after only an hour of play I had to quit the game due to the fact of motion sickness.  Requested (and received) a refund.  I am a newer computer gamer so perhaps someone with more experience, and doesn't get sea sick, will enjoy this game more.  Wish their was a neutral recommendation option as I neither greatly liked or disliked the game.  Only giving it a thumbs down because I could not continue to play the game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Ağustos 2021Ürün ücretsiz alındıErken Erişim İncelemesiTedious. So tedious. Tiny inventory space, small stack sizes (20), alpacas that take tons of arrows to kill, near impossible to kill with a metal spear (not sure how much damage they can take, but it's at least 5 arrows and 1 metal spear shot).The game is mostly about doing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over and over to gain a meager benefit all the while keeping your insanely hungry character fed. Odd balance choices were made.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 Kasım 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiSo... this ""game"". This is a keep the plate spinning type of game. Tons of micro management of resources and threats. Prepare to be the driver of the struggle-bus. [plate #1] Shark. he stalks yous and eats your boat, which you can fend off with 3 hits of a spear but if you dont get the shark right away when it attacks hes going to cost you resources when he eats the boat. You can kill the shark with roughly 30 hits and then its gone for only about 2 minutes until he comes back and its rinse and repeat. [plate #2] Crops. Harvesting crops does not garauntee seeds for replanting and seagulls will eat your harvest in about the time it takes the shark to eat your boat. Even making a scarecrow, which takes a lot of resources, is pointless because the seagulls just attack the scarecrow until its gone so they can focus the crops again. [plate #3] Hunger. Makes no sense to me that i need to eat about 10 fish A DAY to survive, especially when the crafting cost for a fishing pole is 8 ropes and 6 planks. thats 16 palm leaves, though they do occasionally spawn in 3 packs. WHY ON EARTH is it 8 ropes for a fishing pole and no ropes for the throwable hook? [plate #4] Resources. You'll need a lot of them to craft just about anything and inventory space and even storage space is so limited that it makes moving resources and storing things a nightmare especially because you need to research individual resources at the research table and then you lose the item you researched. I researched a giant clam shell and now i cant make a birds nest until i find another giant clam shell cause the one i researched is destroyed after you research it. MAKES SO MUCH SENSE /s. [plate #5] Time. there are points in the game where you are just doing nothing because the game decides to put no lootable ocean trash in your path for collecting and you cant make a fishing pole because of the ridiculous resource reqs and you just end up sitting and starving. Also, the ""world"" moves around your boat and so many thing will be just out of reach of the hook and you float right by islands constanly because making an anchor takes resources and you need to make a new one EVERYTIME you wanna anchor somewhere. Glad that i suffered for 30 mins trying to gather resoucres to make an anchor and then yeah lets say F it and cut the rope when were done with it. [plate #6] Game.  This game is just a collection of mini games on floating wood in the ocean. There is a story (I think) and POI’s but the amount of time and resources it take to get from point A to point B and so forth is asinine. Some games have a pay wall structure and some games have a play wall structure. This game is the latter. IMO it’s just not “fun”. It’s a cool concept for a game but the risks outweigh the rewards 10 fold. I felt like I never had a moment of peace, just frustration with the mechanics. Ive tried all the modes and tried solo play and multiplayer with competent people but the game is just a waste of time. If you like games that piss you off and waste your time, this is the game for you.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 31 Mayıs 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiCloser to actual work than a game, id honestly rather do my real job than play this anymore. All you do is micromanage the same stuff for the entire game, every step of progress is well earned but its not fun to earn anything. Raft makes every effort to artificially delay and destroy the players progress. Its not balanced for singleplayer and feels like an endless chore list, you will constantly be running around like a madman interacting with the same items, refilling the same workstations, building the same items, for the entire game. it never changes or becomes automated enough to make a real difference. You will collect the same basic resources with the same exact method from start to finish, you will keep crafting the same items to do the same tasks over an over. Even when you get upgrades they still require micro-management and still consume resources over time. Each gameplay mechanic is designed to not only use up some kind of resource or breakable tool, but also keeps you from doing other tasks, preventing you from multitasking. I could list reasons I hate this ""game"" for the next hour but I'm nearly done with the main problems. This was exhausting to play, it demands so much mental energy at every moment.Raft pretty demanding on your PC too, near some of the large islands im maxing out a 3080. Its not like the water physics are that great they often don't interact with the raft at all and look terrible at times. The water is odd in some other ways too, during gameplay the seas can become pretty choppy and the raft will move along with the waves. The problem here is that the players water level doesn't change. You can be say 3 feet under a wave unable to swim up because the game THINKS your at the surface, the actual water level doesn't change. This creates more issues when trying to board the raft in choppy water, your getting attacked but the game is preventing me from climbing on my raft because its just poorly programmed.  The movement overall feels awkward and floaty. jumping isn't high enough and you cant grab on the side of the raft so you'll often bounce up in down 5 times before the game decides your allowed back on the raft. The wildlife only serves to impede the player and only presents a threat because you loose 2/3rds of your resources on death. You cant go pick em back up, they get deleted from the game. It also cuts the durability of all tools it doesn't delete in half, usually leaving you with ♥♥♥♥ all to worth with. Its just one middle finger after another with this POS excuse for a game. It's a beautiful game to watch but playing solo is exhausting, frustrating, tedious, repetitive. I could go on but I wont, but I could.",N/A

Stop wasting our gamers time and money...go find some serious investors to release the full game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiAs I have done before came back to this game.....sadly after their so called large update. Still the game set to a normal difficulty is all about food and water. You purify water and fish while trying to keep the shark (that seems to be obsessed with you) from eating your raft. Sure you can put this on easy and food and water are less important though I have not tried. Still there is not much to the game. Sure they may have added to the game but you can not feel these additions.This is not a survival game like 7 Days to Die or Stranded Deep. This is an annoying eat/drink sim. There is no way in the world that you burn off that much food standing in the middle of the ocean on a raft. I got both up to full as I pulled up to an island. Tiny little thing took 2 minutes to run the size of it. Got back to my raft and food was at 25% and water at 50%. Again on NORMAL difficult.So you tell me is this a survival game or a EAT/DRINK sim?Another update to this review for anyone that finds it and is thinking of buying this game. I just read the coming content and I am left shaking my head. In a game about surviving mostly on a raft with better sized islands but still small isolated islands I can not believe what I read. They are going to be adding a Llama to the game!!!! So of all the things you would find on an isolated island in the ocean a LLAMA!!!! As many said in the content section for that announcement it seems no real thought is going into this game. I am so so sorry I bought into this. I thought it had real potential.......Now I feel like it is a real JOKE for someone!!Hey guys if you found this review then I hope you find it useful. So the game is out for quite some time now since May 23 so round up to June first to make it even right......So in that time they have added a ton of content right? Lots of tools and dangers? Nope, no, Nada, not even close. They added in 2 birds and an exploding fish. Larger islands but what an not find them until you get through the first half the game? Going off the changelog here.So all in all only noteable thing they have done is GIVEAWAY FREE KEYS for the game that so many had to pay for. They came out the gate strong and seemed to have a good start. After release quickly became clear they have no management in place or any real plan on how to go foward. Lots of bug fixes, motion sickness mode? Really? You buy a game that takes place 80% on a RAFT on the OCEAN and you have motion sickness, so now devs waste time with that. Congrats devs have given what .0001% of the population the ability to play the game now? Wow!!!Sorry devs but you will never get my money or recommendation for this game unless you step it up. At the very least show that you have a real plan and are not winging the whole thing.Funny thing is if they could they would ban me from writing this review. Just like they did from Steam forums and their website.....wait is there a website? Doubtful. Seems they have your money and lots of it will go to what? Not this game.....To prove my point instead of updates we get game Key Giveaways and ooh come watch a dev build the game......Be nice if they would just build the game and not their ego. If I could get rid of this crap I so would.........Stay away from this game people just do not buy it. Look at the updates they have put out since the release. The fact is they have added really NOTHING to the game to lengthen your gameplay. If you play with a friend you will get maybe 3 hours from the game and it is over. If you play with more than one friend the game will not work. If you play solo you may get about 10hrs from the game. I have the hours I do as I started over after I learned what I was doing.I supported this game day one. I stopped supporting this game when they try to get hype going over silly little additions like adding archery in a game where only thing you fight is a shark and a seagull.Game has great potenial but I am betting that inside of 6 months they will walk away with your money. Base on a recent ban from their forums because I spoke openly and honestly I can say for sure they are college kids. Very young very immature and if they do not like what you have to say they ban you.I stopped supporting Dayz as they were doing the same thing. How many of you have seen developers silencing people that do not praise their game?For the game that is there right now it is pretty good but I will be taking this company into court to get my money and damages back. In America people get a lot more for a lot less. Time developers realise that they can not ban people because they have negative opinions about a game.",N/A

Obviously the developers put some time into this game, but it plays much more like a flash game than something worth $20. I played this heaping pile of canine fecal matter of a game for a little over an hour and had little to no progression, which is somewhat surprising given the fact that I have played the game before back when it was a little indie game on itch.io. The game itself feels much more like a loose storyline than ""an epic oceanic adventure!"", due to the fact that the games 'end' is a wait for more content screen after doing the same repetitive feeling monument visiting over and over and over again.

"Yayınlanma: 13 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiTo summarize my experience with this game on Normal difficulty solo world, ""Durability, no Corpse Retrieval, and Combat kills this game dead"".If I could give this game a ""Neutral recommendation"" I would, because it's in Early Access. The hard jank it gives at times is enough to give me gaming fits (which is a low bar to achieve after 30+ years of gaming), but when it's not doing that it can be down right soothing and enjoyable to play. However, let's get down to the meat of what I have to say.Durability the real enemy here, everything has a meter or gauge to see how much life/energy/time it has. So it's best to over-prepare for everything, just in case you get into a sticky situation, but that is coupled to the resources provided to you. Normally over-preparation wouldn't be a problem if you could get resources in abundance, but you can't because you're a poor raft hobo hoping that the next salvage patch has wood to repair your raft from the constant shark attacks. So over preparation is the name of the game, but that's compounds the second problem of death.If you die from anything, you don't get to retrieve anything lost, it's just gone whisked away to the shadow realm by the developers whims. So just don't even bother carrying anything, because it's a liability to do so on anything above Easy. Just carry the essentials if you can, but what's essential? That depends on whatever you're doing, my old chum. However, even that is ruined by the resource game, because if you can't reproduce or replace something it's just best to restart because getting back into fighting shape while lacking resources is a life goal that only the truly dedicated or the truly over-prepared can achieve.So, if you shouldn't carry anything and over-prepare for everything, what else should you watch out for? Combat, 'nuf said. Combat is by far the majority of your deaths in this game, not the sea or the shark. Bears, Birds, Boars, and Bots are the main form of foe you'll fight here (Rats are a joke). However, you'll have trouble fighting them if you're under prepared and if you're under prepared your bulbous out-of-shape ass can't run from them even if you tried because you're slower than them even while in a full sprint away. No way to escape, so you have to hang and fight, but your weapon just broke so <Insert Respawn Screen here>. Even if you did have a weapon, the enemies have attacks that sometimes they hit you outside of their respective ranges and some enemies deal decent damage so <Activate the Resurrection Suite Shodan>. All around, combat is an absolute mess, avoid it if you can and if you can't pray to god that you have nothing of value on you.Overall, this game in Early access has issues which I hope the Developers resolve. If you want to try it, get it on sale or when it's fully released.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 29 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiits a good game but honestly that shark is annoying, it makes me want to not play the game cause you literally get no peace and as soon as you fix one piece hes attacking another, i get why the dev would do that as its something to keep you busy but come on...im pretty sure on the ocean stranded you would not have a shark at you constantly, really takes away from the game because instead of surviving and crafting im a shark poker.i think the game name Bait would of been more fitting, but you and your raft are literally shark food, and its just annoying all the constant grind to have a weapon to stab it and then having to constantly repair the pieces,i just dont understand why a dev would want to annoy the players, so i cant recommend this game unless you like annoying repetitive game-play, shame really because it seems a nice game after only 5 hours, but i cant be arsed with the annoying shark anymore, its shallow at best and the most basic of AI/enemy you could imagine, something more creative would be welcome, like co-ords to a shark bay or breeding ground where its optional to go to if you want shark meat, not constantly having one nipping at your raft.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 28 Ağustos 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiOkay.  I'm playing this for the sake of my mates.  But I don't like this game for many reasons.1. Food and water meters.2. Shark is annoying.  It was difficult until learning a trick.  Now it's just annoying.3. We have so much shark meat that food is trivial.4. Storage and inventory is bad.  In the early game, we were picking up too many components that didn't have any use.5. Item durability sucks and reminds me of zelda breath of the wild.6. Digging up sand, clay, iron etc is not interesting and the nodes are ugly.  It doesn't make sense for this stuff to be found only via tiny nodes.7. Scarecrow rarely works.8. Decorations are meh.  Some are good, some are bad.  The flag is a white ""Surrender"" flag.9. Exploration was disappointing.  Climbing mountains resulted in half a shack and a crate or two.  One had a radio dish.  We didn't have the components for a receiver at the time.  Not interested in backtracking.Cooking and growing things was probably the only aspect that I enjoyed.  But even then, there is no brewing.  Someone please tell me that there's brewing.  This game needs rum.tldr: gameplay sucks.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 24 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiOther than the start, it's a great game.  I've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one raft to the point where I was setting up the radio transceiver - food wasn't a problem, water wasn't a problem, resources were plentiful, and the survival aspect was effectively a moot point.  Every other time I've tried to play, I've been reminded of how bloody annoying getting started is.You can't stop babying your raft in the early game, as the shark will chew it up and seagulls will steal your crops.  You can make a scarecrow, later.  You can make shark bait to distract her, later.  The game gets interesting, later.But for the first...  call it an hour or so, I'm feeling generous...  it's just that bit too unrelenting.  I think if the shark were to swim off for a bit after chewing on your raft, maybe staying away for longer if you let her chew a piece off, there'd be just the right amount of respite the game needs.As is, it's just keeping you at condition red for too long - starving, dehydrating, constantly fighting off the shark, unable to quickly explore an island to expand your resource base because the seagulls will eat the three potato plants you're growing to keep from starving.  If you stay in one place too long, you'll literally burn through all your wood making water and cooking food.  But you can't harvest islands too quickly, because you have to keep returning to your raft to stop from coming back to a chewed up wreck with all the plants gone.",N/A

Then the island disappears and you get to the open sea die from the thirst or hangry.  If you use the menu button ""escape to the safe place"" it will throw you to the safe place with a shark which will kill you each time with no ability to do something.Probably I can watch some guides on the internet or read some wiki but in this case, I'm a tester and I would like to be paid for the job.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 10 Eylül 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesithis is a good game dont get me wrong but how it handles certain things makes it absolutely horrible to play. the shark is never a threat but a constant, unrelenting pain in the ass. chewing through resources either through breaking stuff or having to fight it off while diving. killed the shark? dont worry it will be back in about 10 seconds....and the hunger/thirst. dont you dare even consider leaving your raft without 8 days worth of food and 10 sippy cups of fresh water because if one of those 2 bars dips below acceptable into the red your pathetic feeble movement speed will tank to an arthritic Parkinson's ridden speed. seriously this game needs a way to enable always ""sprinting"" because the sprint is more like a determined walk and the walk is like a crawl. walking from 1 side of the raft to the other feels like a chore. everything feels like a chore. you dont feel rewarded for accomplishing things, just punished with the knowledge that these resources you spent an hour scratching from the sea floor will last about 5 minutes. also dont farm ever the seagulls make sure that that is a terminal headache, youll kill the shark so often that youll have a chest loaded with shark meat...edit: also ♥♥♥♥ the devs for making this soley a multiplayer experience. seriously dont know why i gave this game a second chance. shelving it until i see them understand that some people want to play ALONEfix your ♥♥♥♥ devs youre so getting worse with every update...",N/A

Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhen I first purchased Raft I was skeptical about playing the game and even after a while with the game i was still skeptical.

I did enjoy this game but for now i don't think the game is worth your money i think if you see it for 10 dollars pick it up but anything above that and it feel like you are paying for to much. the reason i honestly don't think their is enough is because once you get copper and make your first circuit bored it feels like you are entering a tech era but you can only make 3 things with it and that does not feel right so i think this game needs to add more tech items and gas so you can make motors and make your raft more advanced and i think the tease of endgame does not feel right at all i think they should of added a actual endgame cause once you reach what the game wants you to its like is this it and then your back on your raft and the feature of animals is cool plus massive islands but not enough to bring me back.

"Yayınlanma: 25 Mart 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiTheres a good game in here somewhere but ruined by some really annoying stuff.Firstly the bad:My main issue is that there is constantly a shark that stalks you. It has a ton of HP and respawns in just a couple of minutes right next to you. Hel attack you whenever you leave the raft to gather and will even attack the raft, you can prevent this by reinforcing it but this uses metal which is underwater and quite rare. Even with good weapons it takes a while to kill and then just simply respawns shortly after. Taking the effort to kill it should reward you with atleast enough time to gather around an island. The alternative, using shark bait takes just as long. Only certain fish can be used as bait meaning you spend half the game fishing. Making any fish able to be used as shark bait would make the game much better imo. I will admit this is mainly a solo playing issue, when i played with friends there were usually enough of us that someone could distract the shark while the others gathered. Maybe the respawn time or hp needs to vary based on number of players.While talking about the shark there really is a serious lack of diversity, theres only a handful on ""enemies"" in the game. Having different creatures attack you, so long as it wasnt a constant annoyance might make things more interesting.The ok:The building in this game is fun at first but quickly grow stale. Theres very little variety in what you can build, very few decorations etc. It feels like there should be more things to help you build later on, maybe some blueprints for item sorters because at the moment without mods trying to get enough materials and then sorting them all to make a large raft it very tedious. The game doesnt even have an inventory sort feature.The good:The best part of this game is certainly the atmosphere. Looking out to the sun setting, the waves, the music is very relaxing occasionally. That is before you realise your about to die of thirst. The graphics are good enough, though its very taxing on even my 3090, must be the water.Overall im posting this hoping that updates will improve the game. Theres the basics of a good game but theres just so little content and variety i cant recommend at full price. It certainly has potential but actually tends to annoy me rather than relax me which i feel it could be great at.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 MartAhoy, fellow gamers! It's your internet's busiest gaming nerd, Frustranthony Letdowno, back at it again with a steamy, fresh review. Today, we'll be talking about the waterlogged world of ""Raft."" Let's dive into the turbulent waters of this survival game to see if it keeps us afloat or leaves us gasping for air.To begin, ""Raft"" showcases a promising premise that traps players on a tiny, makeshift boat in the middle of an unforgiving ocean. But as we venture further into the watery depths, we find that the end game doesn't quite deliver. It's like an island in the distance that never gets closer - no matter how hard you paddle.One of the most glaring issues here is the lack of automation. It's as if the developers threw us a life raft without paddles. The game's economy hinges on the elusive titanium ore, which is harder to find than a needle in a haystack. In other words, grinding becomes a tedious chore, leaving us more sunburnt and salty than satisfied.Next, let's talk about the boss fights. They're about as janky and unrewarding as trying to swat a seagull with a pool noodle. Although the concept seems alluring, like a siren's song, these encounters ultimately fall flat. The underwhelming rewards from these fights only add insult to injury, making us question why we even bothered to engage in such aquatic battles.Lastly, let's address the game's performance on low-end machines. It's like trying to sail through a storm with a leaky boat. While the visuals and mechanics of the game don't seem overly demanding, players with budget systems may find themselves stranded in the middle of choppy, laggy waters. It's a shame, as ""Raft"" should be accessible to a wider audience of castaways.In conclusion, ""Raft"" feels like a ship that's taken on too much water. The lack of automation, frustratingly scarce resources, janky boss fights, and subpar performance on low-end machines sink what could have been a thrilling voyage into the depths of mediocrity. I'm feeling a light 4 on this one.Anthony Fantano, Raft review, forever.",N/A

I collect stuff and it is written in bottom right, what I pickup, but the stuff is being dropped behind me - extremly annoyin when harvesting under water.when I construct stuff the materials in inventorry are not used up stack by stack and often I'm left with multiple stacks even if it would fit into one stack - anoying....the Graphics is not the best but OK to me, what kinda disturbes is Bruce shwimming through me - same with other annimals. Also weapons or tools I equip are visible even if they schouldn't (not a big problem but no love with details)and there is a lot more stuff which can't realy be considered as a bug but it looks ""cheap""Balancing:is there any?

I havent gone through all of it - so far it is OK and most likely the reason why I still play itCliffjumping... as there is just a little damage you take when falling from high clifs - for some unknown reason i like that :-)Stabillity: so far the game has not crashed a single time - sometimes I need to restart it due the collecting nets are having some strange issue when crusing around for some timeIf I take everything into consideration, I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it to my friendsI'll give it a total 3.5 out of 10 possible reasons",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 Aralık 2022So, grains of salt first.  I'm not a fan of survival games, and clunky combat will always be a huge turn off for me.I really like the idea of Raft.  Sail the ocean, clean it up, build your little island.  Crafting gear and exploring whatever islands happen to appear on the horizon.  But.  I don't think I'll ever return to Raft.  It's in it's full release state, and playing this without mods that increase the amount of garbage that is in the ocean is painful.  Playing this game solo any difficulty other than easy, is painful.  Fighting the shark, the enemy of the game that will harass you until you uninstall the game, is painful.  Between not getting enough supplies and constantly losing them when you eventually get reset by the shark is not fun.  I know there is a way to play the game, but only having one path forward in what is suppose to be a creative fun game, that requires you to play a certain way for 45 minutes plus in the beginning of the experience is not fun.The combat of move to the side and strike when the creature has moved past you is, by every measure, annoying.  The hit detection seems to work great for the shark.  Reread that sentence.  It can hit you far easier than you can hit it.  The boar seems to enjoy sticking you in positions that allow it to consistently pin you in it's attack and you are stuck helpless while it gets in free hits with no punishment.  And the bird has no challenger until you get good enough with the single ranged weapon that you might not even see if you aren't going to challenge the shark to trail by combat.  Everything is faster, stronger, and can hit you better that you can hit it, and at no point in my playtime, did that change.The crafting system is amazing.  From what you can craft to how creative the devs were when they were designing the look and feel of the items.  Starting from your lowly place of having nothing to being able to build a motorized floating island that is self sustaining is amazing.  However.  With the amount of time it takes to invest into getting that far is a test of will, between having to constantly upkeep several different systems that all seem to want to collapse right at the same time.  As well as the Shark who keeps trying to destroy your progress at any given moment.I really enjoy some survival games, but most of them turn into managing how you can tend to yourself and your camp before you can scavenge the world around you and explore it.  Managing a depleting bars, and then being harshly punished by failing to meet your needs, isn't what I expect from a game that has such a 'difficult combat system'.  The punishment of your failure at any point of the games build up is being forced back to zero, and having to do that when you have already spent hours struggling to maintain your health, supplies and composure has not been enjoyable.I really, really enjoy a difficult game.  Whether it's puzzles that break my mind, combat that challenges my timing, or managing my resources to make sure I can survive, I'm up for it.  But most of the games I play are far less punishing that Raft ever has been.  In other games with difficult combat, or clunky combat, you are able to recover your inventory, or don't lose it.  In other games that have resources that fade, there isn't a threat from every angle that is constantly stressing your need for vigilance and upkeep on several systems.If getting supplies was 'easier' or if combat was more than strafing to the side and praying you didn't get hit, or trying to time the birds attacks against you while you engaged it - then this might be a game that I would struggle through to complete.  But as it stands, I am very content to sit back and instead watch someone punish themselves with the odds that Raft stacks against them.If I was playing any other game, and it's reward for defeating a difficult enemy that had been harassing me for the entirety of the time that I had been playing was a forty-five second timer until it spawned, I'd refund the game.  I will not be asking for a refund, but I will be uninstalling the game and hiding it from myself in my library.  And maybe one day, if any of my issues with the game get addressed or if I can get several other friends online to play it at the same time, maybe I'll install it again.  But until then, this isn't the game for me, and I can't recommend something that has frustrated me enough to write a lengthy review.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 27 Aralık 2022This game is so riddled with bugs that it went from an instant favorite to a ""maybe after some more fixes are released"" within 36 hours.Unfortunately, it routinely takes more than 10 minutes for a friend to connect to the game.'Multiple times while waiting for said friend to connect they would spawn into the water and drown before the screens caught up for them.Multiple times my own screen would freeze whilst having the chest/inventory menu up and so the other solution was either to wait until I died via starvation/thirst or to restart the entire game (leading to waiting ANOTHER 15 mins for my friend to connect...)This game has so much potential and we were thoroughly enjoying and working around the quirks until my computer actually blue screened during game play. I haven't had a blue screen in literal years! Sadly, this game is shelved until fixes can be made.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 23 Aralık 2022First of all this game makes me sea sick =/ It also seems like this game is not complete. The gameplay is more like non-stop chores. I'm spending 80% of my time doing the same thing over and over again: get resources to craft stuff to get food and water. You run out of food and water so fast. But the worst thing are the sharks. Why is there ALWAYS a shark in the water. Literally the second I jump in I get attacked. Even not in water sharks are constantly attacking my ship which causes me to defend or repair which again depletesmy resources and makes you get even more resources. This whole game is just getting wood and plastic non-stop.I've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trapped on an island within 10 min of starting a game about 5 times already. With no resources floating my way and cant swim out to get them cuz a shark is camping my boat. Can't believe this isn't still in early access...,N/A

The amount of items it takes to make things is stupidly calculated, 6 planks to make a spear?

"Yayınlanma: 25 Temmuz 2022I cannot really complain about anything EXCEPT the game is just too slow. After 14 hours, I have a raft with radio and full inventory, but no goal to work for. I have heard there is a game story in there somewhere, but I have seen very little of it. I discovered a floating base that gives a little flesh to a story, but after that there is nothing to go on for the next step. I can understand an hour or two but not 14 and the main story has just barely started. My only conclusion is it is a waste of time. I will not waste any more time gathering resources with no end in sight. 25/100",N/A
Yayınlanma: 25 Temmuz 2022It's OK... but that is it.  normal mode that shark gets old... like really old. so I spent most of the time in easy mode just so I could enjoy the game. There are better ways of making things challenging than using the same old shark. the came could be great... not just good. I'm only putting a thumbs down to hopefully get the devs attention,N/A
Yayınlanma: 18 Temmuz 2022Game said i played 3 hours. I had the game in my library for that much time but didnt play for that much time. this game is not fun. its the same things.

"Yayınlanma: 5 Temmuz 2022I can't understand why people have given this the thumbs up! My son and I spent 5 hours playing and we could barely survive. You spend all your time looking for food and we were on easy mode and peaceful mode! Not very enjoyable to play. We even had steak and it barely filled our food bar. I would have to eat 10 items to fill the food bar. Any of the barrels that came our way had no food in them. We had to go on the islands to find food. Not what it advertised!  The tools you can make don't last very long, so you are constantly having to remake them. You would have to do this game in creative. The opening picture show a peaceful raft, but ours had water running all over it. Not fun at all!!!After u-Tubing about the game I found out you must get a fishing pole!! I still don't understand why the makers of this game thought you need 8 planks and rope to make 1 spear. Stupid!!! I mean where is rope on a spear??? If my son wasn't helping me I would have quit the game by now. Thank goodness for u-Tube!",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 Temmuz 2022Oh hell no.Look, survival is a well understood gameplay mechanism that can be fun, tense and interesting when done well.  This is not that.A hook that 'runs out'. A paddle that 'runs out'. Come on, seriously? A shark attack that is largely silent? A tree, once again, that I need to select the axe to chop. No, really, I thought I would chop it with the paddle this time. Truly.Survival is fun when done right.  This program fails some of the absolute basics around that. Avoid unless you like punishment.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Haziran 2022Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiAccording to my friends who recommended me this game is ""THE GAME IS AMAZING""but the thing with this game is just slow paced. Mostly of the time you gotta be going on your boat and waiting to see what happens. The first island that I found I left my boat and it just left me behind ""I UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT JUST TOOK MY BOAT"" but I could not play because the items just spawns close to a boat. I had to leave and start the game over.This game for me is a 5/10 and I requested a refund because is just not my taste.",N/A

There is no body, no loot sack, no drops, nothing. All gone.... Uninstall.Game is the same as when it was released on early access (4 years ago). All the jenkiness and terrible combat mechanics are there but, it got worst cuz they added new enemies.So for 4 (FOUR!!!!!!) years all you guys did was develop more cosmetics and uninteresting/lazy story?

A jank, low effort slog with some of the worst gameplay I've ever experienced.Do you want to hold your mouse button the throw a hook into the water... and then hold that same mouse button again the drag the hook back... with a wooden plank on it!!! Do you want to do this for hours on end??? Then this game is for you!

There isn't much to do besides rope in supplies and build up your raft. If you leave your raft and try to live on an island the island will eventually disappear. You have to stay on your one raft the entire time or go without one. You can't create a 2nd raft for any reason whether you lost yours and need a new one or just want multiple. If the game had more to do outside of living on a raft than the game would be much better in my opinion.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 28 Ağustos 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI hate this game. I know that gives my opinion away right away, but I want to say that before I explain why because their is a lot of reasons why I hate this game. The biggest reason is because I REALLY want to like this game.I will start with the positives because it will be short.Pros:It is kind of pretty, not nearly as pretty as some of its contemporaries, but it isn't bad.This game can be very relaxing and serene at times as you are sailing across the sea.Cons:This game is boring, to put it into perspective my wife was watching the Bachelor on the TV and I kept zoning out and watching the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BACHELOR over playing this boring ass game.All the animals are a combination of frustrating and stupid:The birds drop boulders on your head that you never see that take a quarter of your health and will follow you back to your raft and spawn kill you.The Sharks attack you relentlessly  and destroy your raft and are basically unkillable early game.All the land animals do stupid damage and are annoying as hell to kill because they all have more health than you, are faster than you, and deal more damage than you. And a lot of them don't give you any reason to kill them.The combat is GROSS:Your weapons have basically no feedback besides a red speck when you hit something and feel just... Gross.The range always feels shorter than it is with spears.Your weapons all do like NO damage and take forever to kill anything.Exploration? It feels wrong even calling it that.Every Island feels the EXACT same as the others.Their is nothing to find on most islands.Diving is annoying as hell because of the sharksOutside of islands you have your ship which is basically a floating platform and nothing more.I have never payed a game that felt even 1/100th as empty as this, this makes early no mans sky look like breath of the wildGathering is a NIGHTMARE:It takes forever to gather most resources because if it is underwater you get harassed nonstop by sharks and other fish.It takes forever to smelt things to the point of wanting to die.The survival mechanics are overbearing and annoying:In most survival games you have to eat every 20 minutes or so, which is simple because their are animals every where, in Raft you have to eat every 5 minutes, which requires fishing nonstop which is boring as hell and slowly makes you grow insane.The Water bar isn't too annoying, it can be overbearing, but at least I don't have to spend 1/4th of my time playing fishing for it.Crafting feels weird and DUMB:You learn recipes in a very round about way that wastes your time and requires 100 trips to the wiki to find out what it is that you need to find.Every recipe requires a stupid amount of resources that take forever to gatherAny metal recipes take like 5 minutes to smelt a single ingot, which wouldn't be so bad if the resources to make a Smelter weren't so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HIGH.Story:I haven't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ any part of it at this point since I am only 10 hours in, and NOTHING has happened.I know that seems small, but here is why. After 10 hours of game-play I feel like I have accomplished nothing.It could be the next Game Of Thrones for all I care, it isn't worth wasting another second of my time.Angry rant over:Look, some people seem to love this game, but if you go in expecting a survival experience on par with Ark, Rust, or even Minecraft, you are going to have a bad time.This is a game for someone who loves to sit and not have to think, it is very very very slow and requires more engagement than most other survival games at the same time to make any kind of progress.I suggest you  watch a Youtube video or 2 on it, if you are unsure if you will like it, than DON'T BUY IT.I honestly don't remember hating a game as much as this one, it is boring as hell and not worth your money in  my opinion.",N/A

That's what game-testers are for.The game doesn't really make sense and there's insufficient lore for even a early access game.Why would I pay for something that isn't a final product.

"Yayınlanma: 17 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiBoring game, devs were uninspired in its making and could only find a way to increase its difficulty by having timed shark or bird attacks or food and water gauge dropping faster. Ressource gathering is so slow, you would drop the game even before seeing the first boring generic island (and boy you'll see 100s of them before even getting to the story). Enemies respawn always at the same place and if you don't look at them for like 10 seconds. Everything in the game feels forced and uncreative.

"Yayınlanma: 29 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiGave the game since april. . .but sadly it's still kind of crap. It's only redeeming feature is making a custom neat boat, otherwise, that's it. One could enjoy just doing that I guess, so you might get 40 or so hours out of it before you get bored.I might change this later, but for now the game is a no go if you're going to pay for it.The graphics are sub par for the ram and video usage, but they're not absolutely horrible.It took five goes at starting up not to get stuck against an island and unable to move away from it.Minimal creatures to work with, though given the incredibly small size of the islands (to include the supposed big ones) it's no surprise.Apparently blow fish make explosives. . .apparently some one on the dev team failed basic chemistry, or was just too lazy to look something simple up when it comes to gun powder.Birds drop bombs on you. . .um. . yeahThere is absolutely no tutorial, intro bit, etc.Some of the items don't even work (air bottle)Once you get going, after a good hour or two, you might have an ok raft going. You might be able to make clean water and food, if you manage to figure it out with no help in game and don't look up over half of the functions online.Once again, like so many survival games, the devs have failed to take into account how much a human needs to eat. . .yes you need water every two to three days, but you can go with out food for near six weeks. . .and you certainly don't need ten to twenty potatoes to fill you up. . .Even with the apparent quest line, once you can actually figure out how to get into it, there seems to be absolutely no point to the game what so ever.Because apparently everyone else is already dead.Animals randomly vanish from your raft. . .not sure why this happens.Learned how to make an engine and steering wheel. . .and they don't seem to work, since apparently something else is needed for them. Found the fuel pipe plans and the rest needed for the engine, after having to fight against the wind and paddle all the way to the next spot, note apparently fuel and water pipes are different. . .who knew that you had to use a different type of pipe. . .for another liquid.Later on apparently you need titanium ingots. . .this in itself would be an impossibility, apparently some one failed not only chemistry but also the basic principles of metalurgy. There is no conceivable way a human could smelt a titanium ingot in a brick forge without killing themselves due to the temp needed, let alone why you would need titanium for a water container/battery charger/ and water purifier is completely beyond me.Never found any npcs with hours of looking, with radar and what not.Animal spawns are minimal to non-existent . . .so you will spend hours just trying to find the damn puffer fish. . .or a chicken. . .or a goat. . .or a llama. . .but first the fish, as you can't catch the others until you have it's explosive goo. . .of course they'll just vanish off you boat anyway, so why bother. (Yes, I had food stuff for them and everything.)The tape recordings are text only. . .no voice overs. Hell, I'd offer to do the voice overs for free just to have something more than the barely readable text. (Font size could use an increase.)Good things:The fishing is easy and simple, this is actually a huge plus in my book.The articles and notes have good visuals and are immersive. They tell you exactly how messed up human kind is apparently during a flooding apocalypse (which actually couldn't happen with the amount of water on our planet).True to the games name, you are on a raft. . . but even if you turn it into a boat looking thing it has no directional motivation except with sails (i used two to pivot, it took some trial and error, but four might be better if playing with two people) until you manage to get the engines and steering wheel working.The shark is terrifying, wonderful.Spent a good hour or so checking out the ship that looked like a cruise liner. Lots of rats, neat puzzles.Spent some hours on the desert rock island.Spent some hours in the bubble city (which by the way would work better for a livable location than your raft if you dealt with the robots).Once you finish finding the randomness in the bubble city that's it for now. The notes are great, I just wish that the ones which were recordings at least had a voice over.I would suggest waiting until it's a bit more complete if you are going to pay for this.So, I know it's early access, and I hope it improves. There is a lot of good stuff said about the devs, so lets hope it improves. I will certainly look forward to improvements and hopefully changing my review.Advisements:Use basic sea shells and nitrate salt (which can be made with poop) for gun powder instead of apparent explosive fish.Unless we re using a foundry on that bubble city, titanium shouldn't even be an option given the pitiful level of tech. Possibly go with aluminum, it's more doable.Solar panels and hook ups instead of batteries for everything, or a possibility to upgrade to solar. (sprinklers/radio/radar)Hopefully cosmetic visuals to change your raft parts is on the way.Rice plants so that you can make seaweed rice balls? I dunno, another food option.Make the peas in the bubble city pickable like the strawberries and bananas.Have fruit trees pickable instead of having to cut them down to get fruit with time delay on regrowth. No one would cut down a tree that is constantly providing food.Add the ability to build on the islands, it makes no sense that you can only make things on your raft and that's it. If it's survival, then anyone with sense would set up automated farms and rest stops on the islands, big or small.The engines are slow. . .so very slow, a way to upgrade them would be nice.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Kasım 2020Came back to give the game another go, as some updates came in to fix the bug I was experiencing years ago.I played it for hours and really gave it my best go, but I guess I REALLY just don't like this game.  It's very slow and has no sort of rhythm to get into. Sharks constantly appear to eat my wooden raft, tools break constantly, and solo play is based so entirely around survival in an empty ocean that theres little opportunity to explore or build before you're eaten by a shark or starve to death. This sounds like a high stakes environment, but I was just bored and annoyed during the prospect. There may be a fun part towards the end of this game, but it wasn't worth getting to for me. None of my friends were interested in playing the game with me, which would've made the game more fun, but the fun would've come from hanging out with them and not the game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 Kasım 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiYou need to make it so that your items don't get destroyed when you die, add some system where you can get them back, for example, you have the boxes for each item already, why not just use them to drop when the player dies. I know I could use storage or get a friend to play, but resources are so hard to get already (I have 4 small storages and 1 large storage) and I don't have friends because some of use aren't blessed with the ultimate social skills. BTW - The metal spear is so hard to use against the rats on the yacht, I was only able to hit them when I was crouched, and out of that I could only land a hit 1 out of 4 tries. Fix your game, it could be a awesome game if you tried to make it playable for everyone.I doubt the developers will see this but if they do please try your best to make it easier for single playing.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiRL;DR: Can't recommend buying this game. I played the game when it just came out on itch.io. The game somehow got worse since its itch.io days.Unnecessary resource drains in every corner, an omniscient shark that has it out for the player and literally no-clips through islands and the worst thing is, you are always forced in one direction with little to no agency over where you go. Want to go to that island that you see only now that you passed it? (Because you can't see far off islands when you look directly at them, but if they are in the corner of your FOV, they become visible. Probably a bug, but jesus.) Too bad, even with a sail, you can not beat the current that keeps you going in the direction of some main questline or whatever (I certainly haven't wasted enough time on this game to find out what that would be and I feel sorry for those who did)",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 5 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiGood concept and basic gameplay loop, but terrible controls and lack of industry standard features make this game hard to recommend.The mechanic of collecting flotsam for resources is quite clever, but the constant presence of a shark which respawns shortly after being killed makes this rather tedious after awhile, as objects just out of reach slip by due to the extreme shortness of range at which you can pick things up. And if, heaven forbid, you get to close to the edge and fall in, good luck getting back on, especially if you're low on water or food, even if you have an anchor down. It would be really easy to fix this. If you could press the action key to climb on when you're in the water and close to the raft, it'd be way less infuriating than haphazardly jumping put of the water straight up and down and hoping you can get aboard before the shark kills you.One of the biggest problems I encountered while playing this was that when you die, instead of dropping your items where you died and being able to pick them back up, they disappear forever. This isn't a problem if you put all your things in a chest, but the space in chests is so small and the small stack size of the items mean you're going to be plagued by a full inventory you really want to keep throughout and makes dying a massive setback that just makes you want to rage quit. Especially when you collect a huge haul of loot from an island and are unable to get it back to your raft because you have to go two feet into the water and the shark takes you from full health to zero as you try to get on for almost a whole minute, futilely jumping next to it. Well why don't you just reload your save so you can make another attempt? Because the game autosaves when you die... Why?!? I can only imagine this is because the game developer enjoys making people suffer.But by far, the biggest problem I have with this game is: There is no pause button. If you open your inventory, the game keeps playing, typical for a crafting survival game, right? Adds an element of tension as you have to craft items in real time while the dangers of nature and the fragility of the human condition mean your time is always precious in game however you use it. But if you open the game menu to access options, save, or return to the main menu... THE GAME DOESN'T PAUSE. Need to go to the bathroom quick, check on how dinner is coming along, or change the podcast you're listening to in the background? Better be quick, because unless you save and back out to the main menu ( a SEAMLESS transition of a couple minutes of loading each way), your hunger and thirst will continue to wax as the shark takes chunks out of your raft. This is one of the most basic features in any game, and for good reason. Not having it is a tremendous design flaw. The only justification I can think of is that if you were playing with multiple people you wouldn't want to be paused anytime someone opened the game menu, but not having some form of pause when you're playing alone makes it incredibly tedious to put down for a minute or to pick it back up.In brief, could be a good game, but has a lot of control and gameplay issues to fix before I'd give it my stamp of approval. Go play Subnautica instead. That still has a few bugs, but it's a lot of fun and gamebreaking moments are exceedingly rare and usually easily fixed by reloading the last save.Scores:Gameplay 7/10 Fun to collect resources and get new gearControls 2/10 Handles like the dog's businessAesthetic 7/10 Looks as nice as it needs toUser Friendliness 3/10 The game feeds off your frustrationQuantity of Content 4/10 Not all that much to craft or collect for a survival crafting gameSandbox 3/10 Big world, limited navigational, exploratory, and resource farming capabilitiesStory ?/10 Sorry, if there is one, I couldn't find it.Emotional Resonance 2/10 The nearest I came to emotional resonance was wanting that shark dead as much as it wanted me deadEnjoyable Experience 2/10 Did a lot of things right, but so many things are wrong that it is almost unplayable",N/A

I can't get to an island to even stop for a few minutes.. the amount it takes to build ANYTHING is ridiculous considering how long it takes to gather any of the things that rarely float by.  The shark pops up WAY too much to even start anything.  The fishing makes no sense, so unless one of the barrels randomly comes close to you (which never happens) and contains food (which rarely happens), you starve to death and lose everything.It's so frustrating it's not even fun.  There's no help, nothing to help you start, not enough resources, and starting completely over EVERY time you die, which is often, is just stupid.The mechanics of this game are not well thought out and aren't fun or rewarding like most resourcing/survival games are.I thought this would be a good game and it's proving me very wrong.",N/A

Hire more people!! You expect us to sacrifice our time and buy the game but you're not willing to do the same in developing the game in decent time periods.

"Yayınlanma: 29 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI would have liked to enjoy this game, but I just couldn't get a break trying to play it. I restarted the same world about 5 times, each time ending in frustration over the UI and lack of clear direction and tutorial. I've played many survival games that are quite difficult and put this experience down to poor accommodation of new players. I would say don't waste your time here; many other better titles out there. I'm getting a refund.1. Played 5 mins, saw an island, explored only to find my raft had floated away. Apparently that's a dead-end scenario that I had to look-up online.2. Played 10 mins only to realise my thirst meters had dropped to 10% (no early warning or tutorial to bring attention to this). Then I fumbled through all the menus trying to find a way to get water; had to resort to Youtube to find a content provider to explain it. Even then, the UI prevented me from easily finding the way to interact with the purifier and by the time I realised I needed a second cup to use it, it was too late.3. Played another 10 mins. This time the raft got stuck on an island, and I had used all my resources making a water purifier and spear to defend the raft so I couldn't make a paddle to escape. Another dead-end.4. There were a couple more attempts, but the final straw was having the raft totally destroyed by the shark after rushing to try and get food, water, weapons, spare hooks, etc. Again the UI hung me somewhere where I couldn't switch back to my weapon to defend the raft.This was all on normal. I think the devs need to revisit what the game is like for a new player if they want to see it get a bigger audience. Wish it weren't so.",N/A

Whenever you type in a code for a quest location, set sail and go into the direction, suddenly the raft starts to drift backwards. Sometimes it can be fixed with removing the sail and putting it back. But seems this doesn't work anymore for me. The more you move the sail/steering wheel the faster the raft drifts backwards (sometimes 100 yards per second, which is ridiculous)So I cannot play trough the Story, as I can never reach the destination.

Coming from a casual gamer though, my homie and I have spent hours drifting at sea, losing our raft and lives to sharks (or just a straight-up lack of food), never really getting a break long enough to figuring out the crafting system. The crafting system is really the only thing in the game from what we can tell, other than occasionally finding an island with nothing on it or a partially sunken raft devoid of loot. I'm sure that we aren't playing the game correctly, but with something this simple and stripped down, looking up a walkthrough would close what narrow window of fun this game has to offer.And really, this would all be forgiven if this game didn't tax the absolute bejeezus out of my computer.

"Yayınlanma: 23 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiAfter all the hype about this reworking of the game, I have to say I'm very disppointed.  The ending is still underwhelming.  You're still left building a bigger and bigger raft that's harder to defend from sharks.... just because?  You can literally have 1 small crop plot, 1 grill, and 1 simple purifier and a cup = survival DONE.  ""Oh but there's a shark, and that makes it survival, right?""  Just catch a few fish, make a few shark baits, and dive to your heart's content.  So w/o the survival aspect it's left as a raft building game.If that's your jam, go for it.  Spoiler:  The ending is still just finding a radio tower that says ""oh the world's flooded, have fun with that"" and sends you on your way to just... keep... building a raft. There's no end goal, no point, no reward.  If you find joy from simply putting things together, then this might be for you.  If you're looking for a story, there isn't one.  And if you're looking for survival, there isn't any (just a very small hunger/thirst annoyance).15 hours is all I can put in to it as it stands.

"Yayınlanma: 17 Nisan 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI can see this game's potential, but I just didn't enjoy it. I love survival games and I'm currently playing through one that's still in early access (I'm not sure if I can name it here, but I will say it's gaining popularity). Unfortunately with Raft, I couldn't get far enough in the game to see if I would enjoy the later gameplay. In the beginning, you float on a raft and try to collect passing debris to start building stuff when you reach an island, which I thought was fun. However, when you get to the island, you have to anchor your raft or it will float away and you'll be transported to the middle of the ocean (without a raft) with no way back to land (believe me, I tried swimming). There's no warning when you reach land that you need to anchor your raft. Okay cool, so I guess I'll just kms, respawn, and build an anchor while I'm on my raft. But you can only do that if you have enough materials. By the time I collected enough material to build the anchor, I was drifting further away from shore so I needed to build a paddle. OKAY COOL, material collected, paddle built. After I finished building the paddle, I was too far from shore to see what direction I needed to go in. At that point, I gave up to preserve my sanity. Oh well, maybe I just suck at this game.I'm not saying this is a bad game. I think once you get past the beginning stages, it has the potential to be really fun. But I spent so much time trying to get to land just to be transported back to the middle of the ocean without a raft. It was very frustrating tbh. But hey, different strokes for different folks.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesihey its me, famed steam video game reviewer  ""Gio"" with another review. in this review, im going to paint a picture for you. youre on a raft. yeah thats right, a raft. its the name of the video game. youre on the raft that the game is named after. the raft isnt very big. its pretty small actually, never figured out how to unlock bigger rafts. so the raft moves right? it moves a lot. it moves like crazy. and for no reason too. like it just starts moving and youre like what the heck. you know why is this raft moving is what you are saying. and the raft is actually moving because of the ocean. the ocean is moving so the raft is moving too. so anyway thats the review.i rate this game (raft (2018)) 3 stars out of a possible 17 stars. thats a pretty bad review of a game is probably what youre saying. and you would be right. thats a scathing review of a game. definitely not good. just not much to do in the game. you just hang out on a raft like why would i play that. i was on that tiny raft for 0.6 hours. 0.6 hours. now you might be thinking that thats not a long time, but im no seaman. 0.6 hours on the wide open sea was a long time. felt like an eternity. i think the game would be drastically improved if you didnt start in the ocean. the ocean is pretty boring except for the sharks and stuff. but if you started in like chicago for example that would be pretty cool. like imagine just starting in chicago and then like a tornado or something carries you all the way out to sea. that would be pretty crazy. if you started in chicago i would rate this game like 13 stars out of a possible 17 stars. but you dont start in chicago you start in the ocean. missed opportunity if you ask me. i think that you should start in chicago. but yeah the final star count is 3 stars out of a possible 17 stars. you just vibe on a raft until you fall and lose the raft. not a great game, please add more chicago and no shark the shark is mean and i no like the shark, shark respawn i kill and i die, please get rid of chicago and the shark and please add guns like the ak and the m249 and the one gun from fortnite like me being the skuull trooper killing with ak thank you chicago! wait i think its more like a 5 star out of a 18 cause of fortnite!!!!thanks for reading my review, means a lot. you didnt have to read it but you decided to anyway which is pretty cool. so yeah thats it. thats the review. let me know what you think about the whole chicago idea. i think its pretty solid. pretty great. but yeah thats it. thats the review.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 29 Haziran 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI started from four tiny squares of wood. Days passed of barely surviving while I scrounged what I could. Eventually it grew large into a six by six diamond shape. A research table, a basic desalinator, a grill, a sail, an anchor and five nets. I named this vessel ""The Black Diamond"" and it was well on its way to becoming an impressive beast. I was pretty proud of myself.The time had come to collect clay and sand for a smelter, a risky task. I was doing this solo on hard mode so I was extremely cautious, I made myself two shark baits and thew them in the opposite direction. I thought this was overkill but worth the expense for the peace of mind.Unfortunately the shark bait did not work as advertised and instead of acting as a distraction for 80 seconds I was set upon within 15 - 20 and chewed apart. Hours wasted, I was spitting fire.This is absolutely unacceptable in a game that has been out for a year and I unreservedly recommend against purchasing this in its current state.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe gameplay can be best described as ""Garbage Collection Simulator"". You're abandoned in the ocean with debris surrounding you and your 2x2 raft for some unknown reason which is never explained.This itself isn't exactly a terrbile thing. The game gives you the things you need to be able to play it, it just doesn't tell you anything about what you need to do. You're left to learn how to play the game entirely on your own.The gameplay itself isn't bad by any means. It's quite simple, actually. You collect the debris from the water and you use this debris to craft things. You can learn how to craft additional items aside from what you start with, although this again is not spelled out for you at all and figuring out the research system is entirely trial and error.The absolute biggest flaw with Raft however is the endgame, or lack of.The current ""end"" to the game is to build a battery, a receiver and three antenna, and find what looks to be an abandoned oil rig. Once you reach the top of it, you get an achievement for viewing a whiteboard. This whiteboard is your endgame. From here you're free to jump back on your raft and keep surviving endlessly, or quit the game and wait for a patch where more story and an end may or may not come.While not terrible by any means, at this point I cannot suggest this game. Surviving in this game isn't terribly difficult so really the only thing to do is play endlessly until you get tired and give up.If a patch comes out which expands the endgame, I will update my review.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 11 Temmuz 2022this ain't it chief-voice acting bad-story stinky-no incentive to upgrade most of the stuff on raft - can finish the game with basic tools and upgrades-combat is horribleThis game shines at the beginning when the gameplay loop is fresh and it would shine if a player enjoys decking out their raft with all the upgrades and making it look impressive.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 15 Kasım 2020Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiTL;DR: Boring, repetitive and stupid game mechanics.- Collect leaves and ropes over and over again to craft virtually any in game item from them, but you can not collect them from the plants on the islands but need to fish them out of the ocean, even though they are the exact same leaves.- Kill the shark, which is virtually the only thing in the whole game that will keep you from gathering a gazillion resources within a single hour. But the shark will simply respawn after 10 seconds out of nowhere.- Do not let your raft float away because after it moves away a certain distance, the world will simply despawn because it is not rendered around the player but around the raft.- Turn the shark off in the options to find out how dull and boring the game is, nothing makes sense, no innovative ideas, just gathering the very few different resources over and over again to build a couple different things, none of which make any sense whatsoever in a survival point of view.- The gfx suck monkey balls.",N/A

I died, constantly, because of a lack of food and clean water. Once I got clean water, sharks would just destroy my ship to a point where I couldn't keep up with repairs and my filter was destroyed.

Yayınlanma: 6 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis is the firsst review that I am writing on Steam. I completely love the premise of crafting open world surviving games and I think have a good selection of them and love to play them. I have benn following this game for a long time and watched many You Tube videos of it being played etc. So when it was finally released on Steam even though early access I was thrilled and bought it without hesitation. The game will I am sure advance in complexity and add many new aspects as it journeys towards its final completion. Now here lies the problem with the game and why I am soo dissapointed with the developers. The game is soo badly optimised. I can only play a short while before my PC overheats and shuts down. I have tried saving the game from the menu whilst playing so if this happens I can get back to where I was. Well that does not happen. When I reload the game I have no inventory. All my hard work gathering all the tools in my possesion all gone.It leaves me totally frustrated and angry.  So Mr Developer dont you think this should not have been a thing before you released this on STEAM. Any how as for the game play I cant really give you guys a true definitive review as  I am not able to play it properly. As it stands its  WHOLE HEARTED THUMBS DOWN from me for this game.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 21 Temmuz 2022The game starts out very fun, and the exploration is great, all the progress feels nice. Unfortunately, as you near the end of the story, Raft brutally goes downhill. The story locations are unfun and tedious, new mechanics are introduced to be used once and never again, and the final mission feels awful.The majority of the ending consists of stacking f*cking boxes in a room with enemies spawning endlessly. After finishing the game, you unlock the best tools, which is unfortunate timing because there's nothing to do after you finish the story. There is a lot of grind for what seems to be very little reward.However, the art of the game is great, the game is fun with friends, and I quite enjoyed my time for the most part. I wish there was a neutral review because I don't want to recommend or not recommend the game. If you play with friends, you'll have fun with this regardless.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Şubat 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiYou can please some people most of the time but you cant please all people all the time.TLDR: Go Subnautica. Raft feels like a very, very, very small portion (almost a mini game) of Subnautica.Its not a bad game but not my cup of tea and just not for the tastes of my gamer category. Ill just put this review in case it can help someone else sitting on the fence about this.I see people referring to it as a more ""relaxed"" version of most survival tagged games. After having played my fair share of survival games, both on a more aggressive style (e.g. 7d2d, Stalker, etc.) and more so called relaxed and exploration focused (e.g. Subnautica) I feel like have what it takes to review this.A few points based on the first hours:Food/water: I have never seen a game where you have to literally devour food and drink water so rapidly. Consumption requirements seem so high even for zombie survival game standards.Uninspired gathering: resources float on the water and you catch them with a hook to build stuff. Simple. However, after the novelty wears off (and it did quite fast for me) there is no imaginative play here. I found it a chore to keep on gathering stuff with the hook, then find an island every few minutes, chop some trees, repeat. There's so little thinking involved in how to approach a new situation. You know when you have to strategize in other survival games? See the best way to approach? Gather resources using a different path? Perhaps due to multiple or different dangers?Here it feel increadibly grindy and very, very closed loop.Unintuitive at times: Certain things feel off. Way off. For example to gather rocks you need to... collect them by bashing them with the hook in close range. Um... how about the hammer? Yes, you have an actual hammer tool. You pass all these boulders in islands thinking you can gather some stone in the same manner as in every other game or earth-like reality. Nope. At least not during the first hours i played. You have to use the same hook you throw to catch stuff in the sea, but instead go melee and... bash in on fist-sided rocks. You know how you pick up fist-sided rocks in every other game? You click on them. Also, the first anchor is a bucket with rocks. Nice. I like it. You tie it on your raft then throw it down. Easy. Makes the job done. Why in the sweet name of SCIENCE is this a one-time use item? Why is it destroyed automatically after one use? Especially in the start when you need the rocks and you cant spare making more every time? You cant... pull the bucket up? Was i doing something wrong there? Do ""simple rock physics"" work different in this world?Inventory Management: Inventory management is a game on its own in survival games. Most of you will know what i mean. Here, however, it feels incredibly restrictive and honestly like yet another chore. And that comes from someone playing 7d2d.""Relaxing"": I didnt play the ""free exploration mode"". Just the standard normal mode. I found myself multitasking and micromanaging so many things at once, just in the first hours: spam consumption of food and water nonstop, always keep scanning the horizon for the resources i need (wood, plastic, leaves) so i can hook them, calculate the hook projectile correctly, have the spear in hotkey so i can throw exactly 3 jabs on the shark when chewing on my raft every few minutes, looking over the horizon to scan for new islands, adjust the sails correclty. If i read this paragraph before playing i would say ""wow! all these cool nautical stuff to do!"". Well not really after the novelty wears off. Seems less relaxing than actual zombie survival games. Multitasking is fine when done right. Continuous multitasking just for the sake of multitasking in a game with cartoony graphics that is tagged as""relaxing"" is a big no no in my book. Although i can appreciate why some people can enjoy this.I guess you can say, well, stop multitasking (i.e. stop playing the game like you are supposed to) and just look at the horizon and the sea full of plastic floating towards you. Thats nice for a few minutes. But maybe coming out of Subnautica with so many different biomes and regions and structures and flora/fauna when even swimming a few meters ahead feels like another ""screenshot moment"" wasnt the way to go here.Finally, based on my achievements in the first few hours, apparently only 41.6% of players (at the time of this review) build 100 foundations on their raft. How on earth can someone rate this game if they havent expanded their raft a bit more? I get it that sometimes you dont need tens of hours to review a game (looking at you Mass Effect Andromeda that you ruined my precious trilogy) but it would appear that based on the standard achievements only few people actually played the game in the standard normal mode?Nice concept. But definitely not for everyone.You want to read sea adventures? Read The Odyssey.You want a decent sea survival game? Subnautica.You want to play in the most toxic community in this planet? Play Rito league of legends.Cheers",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 20 NisanThe obstacles in this game are of tedium and frustration. A lot of the game is spent just waiting on the raft while you travel between islands, most of which have the same 2 loot options. And the island enemies are nothing short of super tanks that have outrageous health pools, and that exploit the nonexistant mobility options given to you. The warthogs will charge at you incessantly, and pin you, carrying you across the island. And the birds will drop rocks on your head no matter where you are. And obviously ranged weapons are an option, or they would be if the crafting materials for arrows and bows weren't so rare. The build system is fun, and the loop was enjoyable for a while.

That games that I played 5 hours and saved maybe 20 times just disappear (or were never saved) just goes to show that the developers don't have full control. Several reports about these bugs go completely unnoticed/unfixed by the developers and they've been reported for a really long time. It's annoing as I love pretty much all about the game - just not the bugs?Update for March 2022: I so want to like this game, but it just sucks. After a bird dropped a stone on my head I died and lost all my tools. I had saved, but the game autosaved when I died so I had no way to get back.

"Yayınlanma: 14 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiNice concept but impossible to play. Unfortunately, the lag makes it impossible to collect items coorectly with the hook and climb back aboard the raft if you fall (even on lowest quality settings on good wifi). Also there appears to be bugs with the hook and raft. Sometimes the hook disappears with the rope still in my hand and cancelling/rethrowing it doesn't bring it back. Also if you fall off the raft and respawn it doesn't always bring the raft back and prevents you from building another, leaving you with no option but to begin another new world :(",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Ocak 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiI know very little about this game other than that it's very popular. I immediately ditched my crappy little starter raft and jumped on an island.

It would be one thing if the game informed me beforehand that I couldn't abandon my raft, but it didn't.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2022Difficult and frustrating for all of the wrong reasons. It's a constant grind just to break even with the extreme attrition you are up against. Tools wear out quickly, you get hungry and thirsty quickly, and the whole thing is designed to be played co-op. It's weird and buggy, and the premise is bizarre. Every hostile animal has it out for you, and only you, and your raft. You are at war with every living creature on Earth, and they are allied against you. There is no chance that you are not being attacked. You don't have a moment of respite. Birds are eating your food, sharks are attacking your raft, and will come for you if you get in the water. Land animals want to kill you. And your tools and weapons wear out after just a few uses. The balance is just awful. If you die, you lose 2/3 of your ♥♥♥♥ and respawn with very little health. If you die again you are just robbed blind. If you lose the last piece of your raft, you are screwed. You can't start another one, but it doesn't end the game, but the game is basically over. It just lets you figure out on your own that you're screwed. Nothing is really documented. There's no introduction or guidance to get you started.I tried really hard to like this game, but it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and exhausting. I'm tired of reeling in little wooden planks with a plastic or metal hook that only works a few times.They even disabled offline play for a while when it was released, then they decided that they would magnanimously allow people who purchased the game to play it offline if they want, after thinking about it for a while. I can tell right away that I don't like the people who made this game, so I basically don't have any hope that they're going to turn this into anything I'm going to like.",N/A

I soon realised that survival is not important and you can just keep jumping in and collecting trash letting the shark kill you and repeat. i think if you die to the shark you should loose some loot. If i were to play this game  again it would only be online multiplayer. Overall better then Atlas lol.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Temmuz 2022The concept of this game terribly boring for me. The progression of development is very slow and boring, because you do nothing else, just floating on the water and you need to look around all the time for the randonly coming materials... how is that fun? Also your starting water and food resources are very limited, and it also make the game utterly boring, you need to repeat so many things again and again while you just stand on your raft and looking for those random materials you need.Simply boring, because in other survivor games at least you have the feeling of freedom to discover the land and its nature around you, but here you can just visit some random small islands (mostly) which also don't offer much for you exploring-wise.For me any other game felt more interesting as Rust, The Forest or the Medieval Dynasty, I would rather suggest those if you look for survivor games.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 13 Temmuz 2022Truly one of the most boring games we have ever played. We (3 people in total) bought the game blind because of the insanely positive reviews. One of the biggest problems is there is 0 exploration since 95% of the game is just on your raft. Once in a while you get to an island with the big highlight that you can chop a tree or 2 or kill a boar. Absolutely mind-boggling how this could be interesting to some people. I rarely write any reviews but please please please stay away from this game.,N/A

Yayınlanma: 7 Kasım 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game has a great concept but poor execution. I have never had to write a bad review before because usually I know what I am buying. I have seen people play this and thought it would be fun. It really needs to improve its whole combat system because you cant hit anything unless you are LITERALLY INSIDE OF IT and you timed it just right to hit it just as your animation that takes a full second and a half to do finishes (the bow helps but good luck hitting that vulture thing trying to drop boulders on you). On top of that you cant even progress the game if the wind is pointing the opposite direction of where you want to go for 4 hours straight (until you get way into the game and get an engine propeller thing). I really thought I would like this game but it is more frustrating than fun.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 9 Ağustos 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiumm... There's no matchmaking.

The only people to join my chat group in the Discord try to troll and then leave.It really doesn't make sense for a game built around co-op, to not try and include some kind of matchmaking for the MANY who don't have a group of 4 or 5 to whip out of their back pocket, all who have also purchsed the game.The Discord is NOT a valid solution to this, players want to be able to play the game immediately after buying, not scramble to find a team on Discord which may or may not happen. To top it off, the people who are in the Discord are divided based on where they are, and often trying to join with someone fails because to the PING is just too high with the distance in players.And for those of you who would reply with ""you can just play single player"". No. I don't want to play single player, that's not what appealed to me in this game. Until the flow of this game is fixed, and SOME kind of matchmaking is introduced, I suggest staying away from this game. That is unless you happen to have multiple friends who have also purchased the game. Great idea, dissapointing execution",N/A

I fell in the water and got eaten by the shark that follows you everywhere because I couldn't manage to get back on the raft. then, finally, an island. a crappy little island with flowers on it. raft got stuck and I couldn't get it out not even with a paddle. So I started a second game. This time I knew what I was doing and it was gonna be better. Nope, same thing except I didn't fall off the raft but couldn't avoid getting stuck on a crappy little island again. Maybe its just me but this game is annoying.

"Yayınlanma: 3 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI thought this game would be based in reality, and a raft survival game seems fun, but islands where birds constantly drop rocks on your head, and a ship with unlimited mutant rats that constantly respawn quickly makes the game more annoying than fun. Get real, the rats would all be killed, there is only so much space so there could only be so many, so having them constantly respawn is unrealistic. So is endless supplies floating in the ocean, but without that there would be no game at all. Killing the birds that drop rocks on your head constantly (totally unrealistic) is pretty stupid, and they are tough to kill, even if your a good shot. It seems like most of the time you hit the target and it doesn't even register, plus it takes way to many to kill those birds. Let's face it, where have you ever been where birds pick up giant rocks and try to drop them on you. There could be better mechanics in the game that make it challenging besides the birds on the islands. The boar is a perfect example of this. They are just right, the bird is too much. Alot of the animals in this game are just to focused on the player, in real life I don't think it would matter unless you became a threat to them. IE If you try to shoot them or go near them homes then have them target you, not as soon as you get in the island the constant attack starts and doesn't end till you leave or die. If you left the raft why would the shark still attack it. Just things like that make it way too frustrating and no fun to play.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Nisan 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiI really want to like this game, but I don't. The idea of survival, and building up your own ship sounds awesome, but the experience of it is boring.The interface is terrible. It feels like an old game in all the wrong ways. Combat is rudimentary, and hit detection is unreliable.One of the later game elements is capturing animals. You'll put lots of resources into capturing a single animal, but sometimes animals that you've put lots of time into, named and cared for will simply disappear, despite fencing and placing them in safe places.It requires too much out-of-game research to figure out how the game wants you to play it, rather than being intuitive, or having helpful in-game tips. I may give it a bit more time and update my review if things improve, but so far, it seems like a skunk of a game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 20 Aralık 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiAsk yourself if you want to build palettes in the water for hours on end.Edit: Figured I should mention I made this review unsure if it might adjust some of the recommended games Steam gives me. I don't think this game is bad, but it's a sandbox game and by sandbox I mean kiddie pool. Sandbox/open-world games are hit or miss for me, and that's mostly what this is.Main gripes would be the game feels pretty monotonous in the early parts of it. Most of the variety will be largely what you want to put together for your raft. I found this process tedious and it seems like a large chunk of the game. There are other areas to get to but you'll want to commit a good amount of time to approaching it with trial and error or getting a friend to help you out.Again, I can't really say it's bad.

"Yayınlanma: 2 Nisan 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiHad it on my wishlist for a while because the premise seemed interesting. I realize this game is in early access, but I know it has been purchasable and playable for long enough for me to take qualm with its mechanics and flaws. I've played a decent amount of survival/crafting/etc. games. It may be unfair comparing Raft to Subnautica since it obviously is developed by a smaller team on a smaller budget, but it's difficult to not make such comparisons.My main issue with Raft is that it has a lot of tedium, especially in the early game. I didn't beat the game, but I got part way into the 'story'. It picks up a bit once you get certain items, but ultimately the game feels like going from one tedious thing to the next.You need resources underwater. But you need hook durability to harvest them, plus you need to distract or kill the shark or else it'll kill you. But you need resources for the shark bait or spear, and you need resources for the fishing pole (because it also has a durability) to catch the fish for the bait. You can use equippable items to increase your underwater breath/speed, but those take a hefty amount of materials (that you can only get underwater) to craft, and are completely DEPLETED after a measly 10 minutes. It seemed like the entirety of the mid-game was going to islands, distracting/killing the shark, and harvesting underwater resources until you can craft certain items.Hunger and thirst deplete quite fast as well. You can just build little farm things to grow infinite potatoes, but even a cooked potato restores maybe 1/20th of your hunger meter, so you gotta keep downing them all the time. Once you start getting meat in the mid game it becomes easier to manage, but hunger still doesn't feel like much more than tedium when it depletes so fast. A note about the 'higher tier' cooking, with the cooking table or whatever it is called. It requires bowls, but bowls can only be crafted by clay from underwater, and after eating the food out of the bowl you DON'T get the bowl back. So you gotta craft more and more bowls just for slightly better food.Protecting your raft from the shark gets pretty annoying as well. In the early game your raft is small enough that you can hear the audio cue when the shark is chomping on it. If you get there fast enough you can get him off and repair it. But once my raft started getting bigger, he could chomp off part of my raft and I would be none the wiser. I'd be going to check something and see a chunk of my raft just gone. You can fortify sections, but they take a TON of materials if your raft is decently sized like mine was. So ultimately the shark attacking my raft never felt like a threat, just annoying... aka: more tedium.Ultimately though, I think the difficulty setting and death is the biggest offender here. Yes, I quit playing after I died for the first time. You could play on normal, or easy. In easy you keep your inventory on death, so there are ZERO consequences to death. Played with a friend for a bit and I just kept jumping underwater, gathering items, getting killed, repeat. It would respawn me with ~25% hunger and thirst, and like a third health. Ultimately I realized I might as well not even eat or drink most of the time, since I can just respawn with pretty much no downside.On the flipside, if you play on normal and you die, you lose your entire inventory and everything you are wearing, you CAN'T recover it from where you died, and the game automatically SAVES when you die. All of your items are deleted. This is way too far. Even in a hardcore game like Valheim you can recover your lost items, or in Subnautica you only lose a portion of items. You also do not have the option to change the difficulty in game. Once you select your difficulty at the start, you are locked into it. Maybe some people like that sort of thing, thus they should have a higher difficulty setting that offers that. But from my perspective, it is ridiculous to have no difficulty setting between ""Zero consequences from death"" and ""Lose everything permanently and automatically saves the game when you die"". So when you die, what does that mean? More tedium to get back your items.So I just stopped playing, because I didn't want to put the effort into gathering materials and re-crafting everything again. This would be unusual for me, however I wasn't really having all that much fun to begin with, so I was almost relieved that I had a good excuse to quit. The bits and pieces of the 'story' are very cliche at this point in their tone (just more notes left behind by other people, either directly and blatantly exposition of the 'lore' or silly ramblings about random stuff, like you see in SO many other games of similar genre). The music is omega bland, at least the 20% of the time it is playing, and might actually be the weakest aspect of the game (which is saying quite a bit imo). Just more cliched 'light and airy' piano tracks that seem to be copying the trend yet again.The most fun I had in the game was when I started facing off against the shark underwater, and I had to time my spear jabs to kill it. This made gathering materials underwater smoother. The timing is a little unforgiving though, and would absolutely be impossible to pull off in multiplayer. Fighting pretty much everything else in the game was just some variation of ""Stab. Backup. Stab. Backup."" though.So ya, had some fun moments. But in the end it was just a lot of tedium with not nearly enough pay-off.TL:DR: Too much tedium. Bland/cliche 'story'. Horribly bland music. Desperately needs its difficulty settings tuned.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 Eylül 2022early game survival is fun, but this game was never designed to have these huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story areas. it feels so forced and disconnected from what is actually enjoyable about the game. when you have enough unlocked that survival is no longer an issue everything in the game becomes a nuisance. especially if you are playing as a solo.all the enemies in the game aren't challenging at all they are just tanky. the shark never stops attacking even when you are in story islands where you have to be away from the raft for a long time. so when you come back all your ♥♥♥♥ is destroyed. the giant bird is almost impossible to hit and it just flies around dropping ♥♥♥♥ on your head.when you become hungry or thirsty your character slows down to a snails pace. again this isn't a problem early game because most of your time is either on the raft or near the raft. but when you hit the big story areas and are a long way away it just gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying to have to crawl back to food while the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bird drops hot loads on your face. i don't have a scat fetish and i'm not german.all this would be bearable if the story itself was any interesting but its not. its stock standard boring ""greed and spite killed the world! we could have survived if it wasn't for human nature!"". it brings nothing new or interesting to the table and it feels like it was written by an esl.so to pad out the last half of the game they have the worlds most boring and tedious puzzles that boil down to just being time wasters so that you don't hit the end within 8 hours. you wanna go collect parts for an hour just so you can build one item only used on that specific island? no? have fun doing that for literally half of your game time.games ♥♥♥♥ and almost unplayable past 10 hours. instead of forcing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boring story down your throat they should have focused on the survival. cause that's the only part of the game that is half enjoyable.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiMore lag, more bugs and less content than Minecraft.Unfair comparison aside, this is a pretty charming game, but there are some features that ultimately draw my attention away from the juicy parts of the game, in a bad way.- The usual survival mode has hunger and thirst that forces you to spend half your time fishing/foraging and then cooking food. Understandable especially for that early game threat, but as you sink hours into the game, it becomes a huge annoyance and time sink. After that, going Easy mode (disabling hunger, thirst and the shark attacking) makes you realise how much of the game is really just that grind for survival.- I hate the parkour that is forced on the story islands. It's just, there for the sake of making things tediously difficult to reach. There are no items in the game that help your mobility, and after trying and failing a few times, you realised you just wasted some water and rations for nothing.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiBrutal if you intend on playing solo, the game keeps you at a stalemate by using the shark, you don't get nowhere near enough wood to maintain a grill, water purifying station, repairs and building, everything uses planks of wood.At any point the shark can catch you with not enough wood to make a spear and break your foundation, wall and roof in one attack, even if you do repel him in time he'll usually leave your structures with about 25% health, so he can come next time and finish the job.The only way I found to get wood was to jump on every possible island I saw and break the trees down, thing is I would leave with maybe 40 planks per island, considering how it takes 4 planks to make a single piece of foundation its not nearly enough.You can plant trees on your raft, but I was getting maybe 5 wood per tree, which considering the time it takes for them to grow and how many resources you need for the big plot just purely not worth it.I had a few lines of nets on my raft to grab wood, but at some points in the game you just go through these 20 minutes of clean water with absolutely nothing to grab, considering how the shark attacks you every 5 minutes like he has a clock to make sure he's not a second late, you have no chance of making anything but the bare minimum, maybe less.Buy if you intend on playing with friends, alone it feels miserable.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 22 Haziran 2022This game should not have left early access the way it is.Feels very buggy and unpolished, and the core gameplay loop is made up from a handful of extremely tedious tasks, which other reviewers have detailed far more clearly than I feel like bothering to. Honestly, it makes it feel like you can't even relax for a second or leave the computer while your friend keeps playing.On top of this the progression (not story but actual gameplay) is 100% limited behind grinding. No leveling, no talents, no perks, no exp, just endlessly collecting sea rubbish.If you like in-depth complex gameplay and feeling like your skills are being challenged, this is not for you.If you like building huge crazy ship cities, this is for you, but specifically in creative mode.As far as gameplay depth goes I would equate this more to something like Farmville than other survival games like Rust, 7 Days To Die, Zomboid, The Forest, etc.I would have found out I would not like this game if I had read some of the more detailed critical reviews, but I just saw ""overwhelmingly positive"" and clicked buy.

"Yayınlanma: 1 Kasım 2022Not bad at all. BUT comparing to other survivals (like subnautica, the forest, green hell, which are the same price) this game fares poorly. Why? Candy graphics (Not realistic), AI is very very simplistic (just goes to you if you are close, and that's it), not optimized (I have 3060ti and average CPU ryzen 3, and it lags when you look at the big island). Also it is pretty boring after some time. You just go by a raft from island to island (which are repeated!).Like I said. Not bad game, but not for 15 bucks!",N/A
Yayınlanma: 25 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI spent  6.5 hrs already on here and it took me about 5 to realize the research table didn't need the blueprints to research things... and that each crafting material goes in there at cost of one piece to research it.

It's very much trial and error learning as there's no tutorial at all. So, if you go to an island, it disappears under you because the game wants you to stay on the raft. If your raft gets eaten and you have no materials, you're going to get stuck in an endless loop of being eaten by a shark over and over. I feel like this is an overgrown iOS or Android game.Ultimately, it's like Groundhog Day, but with sharks.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2022Looking for a realistic survival game with free sandbox gameplay? - Then this game is probably NOT for you.But it can still be a fun and interesting game, especially with friends.EDIT: Never mind, this game design sucks. Normal/Easy mode is too simple but in Hard mode it's game over if you're playing solo. I'm fine with losing my inventory and such but blocking off all save states and no chance to revive at all if solo? Just why? Unfortunately, it took me too long to die in Hard mode so I can't get a steam refund. This is not about difficulty (Hard mode is not that difficult - but one of the glitches might get you eventually, like being killed by a bird under water), it's about lacking options and being locked out of your game in solo.My old review:Let me start with the bad stuff: The world design and resources very unrealistic. The same goes for the gameplay (you can't create a second raft, you are bound to your raft, you can't build on islands and if you lose your raft it's game over). There are questionable design decision (the waves on the beach will have the shark fly around or resources becoming unable to be collected - this seems weak for a v1.0 game). Especially in the early game your raft can get stuck on islands which is frustrating. The islands are (as far as I have seen) not generated randomly and become repetitive. They spawn/despawn periodically in your way.The good stuff: It's fun if seen as a resource-collection and (raft) building game, especially with friends. The exploration is fun if you're ok with staying on the track the game wants you to go.",N/A

It seems like they designed the game to be annoying. Everything from the hook flying through the air slowly, the shark that just randomly breaks your boat, everything about the fishing, how long batteries last, even the wind seems to intentionally be trying to irritate you. And just wait until vultures... As a huge fan of survival games, I don't get the appeal here.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Nisan 2021I don't know how to describe this game, beyond that it seems like it was made by aliens.The first lesson it teaches you is left click to use the item you're holding (the hook you start with). That's a lie; the hook is the only item you use by clicking.There are a bunch of boxes at the bottom of the screen. They're hotkey buttons, but they don't have numbers on them. So I just sort of press keys at random to narrow in on what I want.When I build something, nothing happens. It's being silently added to my inventory. I have to go through my inventory and add it to the hotkey bar, and then select it there to build it on my raft.After a while, I figure out that I want to get rocks, which are unsurprisingly not floating on the sea's surface. So I go to an island. There are no rocks on islands. Rocks only occur underwater, and they look like air bubbles. They have a hook icon on them. Click on them with the hook equipped does nothing.I am hungry, and the island has a tree with fruit on it. I can't pick the fruit. You must use an axe to pick the fruit. It takes stone to build an axe.I am thirsty. I build a simple purifier and use a cup to add saltwater. It does nothing. There are no contextual prompts. Eventually I wander by it again while I have a wooden plank, and I have the option to ""add plank."" This lights a fire under it and it makes water. There's no way to take the water. There's a ""remove"" prompt on screen, but ""remove"" means ""deconstruct"". For some reason you have to re-equip your cup and transfer the purified water to your cup before you can drink it.I want to take control of my destiny. I build a sail. Using the sail causes the resources to stop spawning. My notebook says reaching an unending stretch of blue means I'm not paying attention. I carefully watch the waters for a few minutes. Then I google it - the sail just turns off resources. If you stop using the sail, they start spawning again.This game has an appealing concept, but so, so painful to interact with.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 5 Ağustos 2022Let's be honest: You came here because of Markiplier.Sorry but I have to tell you this game is really, really bad. Controls are clunky an imprecise, player agency is stripped away at every opportunity, and the world does everything in its power to push you AWAY from valuable items and points of interest. Its not even that the game is a rewarding challenge to overcome like a Souls game, its merely obtuse for obtuseness' sake. Case in point, you literally have to eat and drink more in an in-game day than you do in real life. Most of your time will be spent scrambling to maintain your bars so that you don't die and lose half of your painstakingly earned stuff, and the game is actively programmed to deny you the resources you need to build the things you need in the moment.Raft hates you.

"Yayınlanma: 10 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game has much potential right now, but in its current state, the game content stops right about the moment things can start to get interesting.Me and my friend finished it in about 12 hours in our first playthrough.The early game was understandably a little bit long, as we had to build our raft from basically nothing. We tried to build a good and fleet as early as possible, so we about a 14x14 sized raft.SPOILERS:The main issue i have with the game is that when the ""mid game content"" started, that is when we first went for the ocean rig which unlocks large islands, things went way too fast. There was little to no reason to unlock or use the things that we unlocked. Within a few hours we were at the final island with the big bear, and finished the objectives there.Summary:Dont get me wrong, the game has alot of potential, but in its current state you will feel blueballed by the game, where the progression stops the second things start to get interesting.This might change later in time, but for now the will have a negative review. I will change it later in time if new content comes and the developers fixes the issues i personally have with the game.",N/A

The sheer lack of content besides building a floating home is a bore. The only real threat besides stravation and dehydration is what? The shark? Turns out its super easy to kill and besides some shark meat and the head you get zero for doing it. You wil begin to just hope he attacks your tiny raft when you are bored 1 hour into it.

"Yayınlanma: 25 Haziran 2022I started the game and began looking for sustainable food and water sources, just like I do in every survival game. Unfortunately, Raft gives the player absolutely no guidance whatsoever in this regard, which, when combined with the game's procedural level generation, led to me starving to death almost immediately. And frequently.During one of my lives, I managed to build a small planter plot, but for some inexplicable reason, the developers decided that not only can you NOT put a planter pot on an island (standing there with my finger pointing at nothing, for minutes at a time with no prompt or help text at all), but also that the small planter cannot hold seeds for much of the food I found. So I scrounged for a seed of the right size, found and planted a potato seed, waited an irrationally long time to harvest it, ate the new potato, and was rewarded with ZERO seeds afterward.With no other resources in sight, and my hunger meter always on empty, I felt I had no choice but to uninstall.

Most of time you just clicking stuff on your boat.. to add wood, to cook something, to melt something.. to purify water.. to hit shark.. hit gull... soooo boring... if u stop for couple minutes - you probably starve to death. And its not even challange.. The worst thing - you need to do that all game. All crafts insanly high cost.. and you cant repair tools.. you need to craft them again.. So you grind.. to craft some tools - to grind faster, to be able to craft this tools again... soooo stupid.. And the fight system... its probably better to fully remove fights from this game..I play with friend.. otherwise i probably drop this games much much faster. My friend convince me to continue playing, cose he believes things can change later.. and things change - we both get killed by mama bear - we respawn on raft naked, and there are no resources to craft at least half of required tools for 1 person.. My friend was dissapointed, but i was sort of happy to close and delete this game.Just to clarify -  i am realy patient men.. im ok to spend 50hrs to build hardcore character which dies eventually... im ok to build huge base in 7 days to die and delete save just to start again... the main requirement - gameplay should be fun, which is totaly oposite to what this game feels like..",N/A

HOURS.... disappeared... Cease to exist. The bear apparently ate 3 engines. The reason I'm giving this a bad review is because you don't even get a warning when you start the game on normal that you might lose everything you are carrying. I'm glad I didn't die in the sea, because I would've spent hours swimming looking for my stuff before realizing it had gone kaput. Please add a warning. or simply eliminate the inventory disappearing from the normal settings.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiWELCOME TO RAFT VERSION 1.01....  the..... prerelease.... early access...but yeah VERSION 1 point ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 01..... (note devs: ver 1.0 should not be a pre-release version.... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.)The first 30 min are great.. scailing difficulty of the islands, needing to have a talller raft to get the resources. Then you realize, the game SUCKS at building verticaly.. The ladders busted as hell (1/4 of the ladder is invisible, seriously, try building a couple on a stack of raised floors), the stairs are, interesting. the walls crash the game when you jump on them. So you restart the game a few times, improve your early game performance, try out creative to get a handle on all the terrible build glitches.      ABOUT 3HRS DEEP NOW.....   no room for refunds ^^So, yeah.. My experience, continued: I get enough resources on my 7th world to make it ontop 3rd level of the 3rd island but... oh yeah.. the shark can glitch thru ANYTHING.  so your 2 different anchors that should be safe in center of the raft are destroyed.. away i drift.. noclip shark for the winat this point.. i decide to uninstall..All in all.. for an early access.. 7/10...I am an idiot and thought this was a official release, and basing the review on V1.01... i'd rate it 3/10Thanks for tanking my $20.. maybe in a year or so this game would be worth that much... but for now... it's not.... but enjoy my money anyway b/c steam refuses to refund w/ 4hrs played...   well played raft team, well played.I would recommend revisiting this game sometime in 2019.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 10 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis wasn't fun for me, frustrating really!The game throws you in immediately, doesn't pause when you want to change settings, doesn't pause when you open crafting menu to see what you can do, in a Survival game with harsh survival mechanics! You lose food and water fast.Started first time, after I built the water purifier and the 'stove' the shark came and ate one of them, and I was already hungry and thirsty.Second time, got it right, made the hammer, built extra tiles, got stuck on an empty Island and could no longer move, had to swim to get crafting components, was starving and thirsty, the stupid shark got before either of the two though, and lost ALL my items, I don't believe it left 'my backpack' where I died either, so rip all items!!! FUN.Tried a THIRD time to really give it a go, got bored of repeating the first 2 steps, especially collecting everything again and building all over again. And HOW do you light it on fire? WHATEVER! Very frustrating to start your game like that tbh, especially with an annoying shark, too much going on at the beginning.

So for the game itself:This game is not really good for newbies. It's very hard even if it's in easy mode. Sharks constantly bites your raft like every 2-5 minutes and it really sucks. You constantly build fear if your raft is too small because your stuff can be destroyed if the foundation is destroyed.

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiIn its current state, Raft is relaxing, and pretty fun. I like the art style and the general idea of the game. However, it lacks content. You might play the game a few times, and really enjoy it, but that's about it. There are only two things you have to do to survive: not fall in the water and die to a shark, and not starving to death. It is so ridiculously easy, and after you make a purifier and a grill the only thing you get to do is expand on your raft and explore. What little story there is in this game is simply not worth pursuing. The game is charming, but like many games, lacks anything to support itself. Even when you buy this during a steam sale, I can still say that it is not worth the money. I have no doubts that this game will be better in the future, but in its current state you shouldn't get this game. One last thing for the people who are willing to play this lifeless game: the experience is far better when playing with friends.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 26 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiPretty meh game, idk how to get to any of the stuff seen in trailers so for me its just about waiting for the right garbage to float past so you can craft a paddle that breaks after a minute of use, so you may or may not be able to paddle to a tiny island that doesn't seem to have a point other then picking up a food item or two. I really dont get why this game got so much praise, what a let down.Reading other peoples reviews it looks like its fun when playing with friends (still, how though? do you need more players to get less sucky islands?) but i bought it too late for that, my friends stopped playing long before i got it.@devs: maybe consider testing the game as solo players, theres little to no fun to be had as solo player, only a mindnumbing grind where you're stuck waiting for the slow stream of random crap floating by wishing it was some other parts you actually needed, and thats without a clear goal, game REALLY needs some guidance for new players.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 9 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game has a sense of relaxation and fun progression when u slowly turn your 2 by 2 meter raft into something larger, where u grow your own food and add a steering wheel, etc.The first time you find an island you go like, ok this is great im gonna hang around here for a while and build stuff.. and let your raft slowly drift off. Oh the game doesnt want you to do that.... u die. Fine... ill stay on the damned raft.(so no freedom)Before long you find the most AMAZING places still left over after the apocalypse. Yet no way ur gonna stay there... gotta keep going and build a bow and arrow out of crap, whilst u could be chilling on that specific amazing place.... ;)(so the logic kinda goes out the window)Then there is the idea of what this game can actually accomplish. Its engine lends itself from sailing very well. Action, fighting etc not so much. There are clipping issues when 'fighting' with sharks and birds, and hitboxes are screwed up. On top off that enemy AI is super random based on imaginary paths etc. OK so why do I mention this... Because its not an action game? WELL IT IS AN ACTION GAME. prepare to face endless waves of mutated RATS that respawn constantly. Listen, its fine this isnt a great action game... Then keep it to a minimum. Apart from that action system and the inventory items that break, run out, or health or thirst that start pestering you and force u to go back to your raft. What else constitutes as gameplay.Well. its just... find three rolls of tape in order to fix some wiring. Ok done... Lets find three more rolls of tape for some more wiring. How about doing that some more. What an uninspiring way of implementing gameplay into what places u are exploring.In conclusion:First few hours were great, just messing with the raft.every bit of story based gameplay exloring the added 'Discovered places' is absolute PooPDo not buy",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiWell after just showing up with absolutely no context whatsoever, not even a tooltip as to how to make stuff. I finally managed to rope enough crap for a build tool. I used it 3 times then it disapeared. So I got enough to build a water purifier then the shark eats One of the planks its on and it too disapears. I am going by an island with a bunch of crap around it. No stones for anchor (somehow it moves quickly against the current) but since the shark took me down to 3 squares anyway, i figured id start a new one anyway. I am off to good start on the island, almost got enough to start then with a bunch of extra stuff. Boom... I am in the middle of the ocean. No stuff either.Yeah maybe I will try it again if I live long enough for it to get out of EA, which is doubtful. Pretty much the only thing keeping this travesty going is a bunch of fanboys.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 13 Ağustos 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe scenery of Raft is incredibly atmospheric, relaxing, and beautiful. The gameplay of Raft quickly turns into a grind, and gets old losing much of it's appeal fairly quickly due to Raft still being developed. The storyline of Raft is quite depressing, and produces an extremely dismal backdrop worse than the most atmospheric zombie games like Dying Light. If you ignore the storyline, and just enjoy the gameplay Raft might be worth purchasing since you'll get a significant discount since Raft will be a fair bit more expensive upon release. Ultimately I can't suggest you purchase Raft in it's current state. I would suggest to wait till the game has been fully released to ensure there is enough meat to Raft's game world, and gameplay that will ensure you will enjoy what Raft has to offer.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 20 Ağustos 2022Refunded.  Play Stranded Deep instead.  This game starts you with nothing in the middle of the ocean with no tutorial and relentlessly kills you over and over such that death has no point.

"Yayınlanma: 10 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhat if Minecraft, but fishing? That's what Raft is. It's Minecraft, only instead of exploring a world and gathering materials you sit on a raft and use a fishing hook to haul in construction materials while occasionally a shark eats your raft for no good reason.It's very slow-paced, very boring, and the multiplayer is limited purely to people on your friends list - there's no server list or any way to play multiplayer with people you aren't friends with. The game follows a formula that's more or less:Stage 1: Fish out materials using your hook. You can't leave the raft or you die to a shark that is constantly following you around.Stage 2: Hit an island and probably find yourself unable to do anything because you don't have the materials yet or haven't been reading the wiki constantly because this is one of those games.Stage 3: Shark attacks and bites a piece off your raft unless you have a weapon to hit it with.Other games have done what this one does better.

There is no actual pvp, or pve aspect this game has to offer at all. The best form of fighting is literally hitting a shark with a spear over and over again, till it dies, but the shark only attacks your raft occasionally, which basically means its standing with one finger up your ass, and the other getting resources. 20$ is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke. It should be more like 5$, and when Steam sales roll in its free. If you have under 2 hrs on the game.

"Yayınlanma: 11 Nisan 2021I have purchased and refunded this game twice. One in early release, one in ""1.0"".The resource acquisition is stupid and tedious. The music sucks. Gun to my head I couldn't tell you what their songs are.The ENTIRE POINT of a save system is to learn from your lessons and practice, but if you dare to die, enjoy an extreme amount of punishment, zero way of mitigating it. Every mod I've seen has been to balance and mitigate a bad game design into something useful. You lose almost all your inventory and take a ton of condition damage.Your progression gates are originally a shark that constantly stalks you. As you progress beyond caring about it, you have weapons, you have ample food, you have plenty of resources, you dare to go to an island. Where animals attack you with AOE hitscan. There is no level of prep you can do, there is no grinding you can do. You just have to take it. You will have zero mechanical training or warning about this, it is an entirely new form of combat and they brutally punish you for being stupid enough to not immediately adapt.And restoring to a previous backup? Out of the cards unless you manage your saves manually. The toddler devs cackle with glee as you have to sink another 10 hours into a slow, boring, tedious process to regain some semblance of stability just so you can try again to not die to a bird dropping rocks on you in THREE HITS.Let me reiterate. They have a hardcore mode. The NORMAL INTENDED BALANCED GAMEPLAY. IS TO NUKE OVER HALF. OF YOUR INVENTORY. IN A GAME ABOUT HOARDING RESOURCES.Another no name studio who found some semblance of success that decided to draw the game out as long as possible with sad small updates. There will not be a 2nd game, they'll make what paltry money they can from this pathetic trickle of sad updates.Their parents will quickly learn not to ask what game is next, they'll just be happy their kids stopped asking for money. For now.There are better survival games out there that are far more fun. Avoid this game like shark infested infinite ocean with mediocre draw distance.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 Nisan 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiOverrated, positive reviewers have probably never played a survival game before. the ""difficulty"" is just how much your water and food rains faster, and the islands are all the same. litterally no replayability, its the kind of ""survival game"" you give your parents who dont game, and put it on the easiest setting for them. ""exploration"" might as well be ""float to the same islands as everyone else has seen, with nothing special."" bare bones survival mechanics, barebones crafting, barebones mechanics in general. example: in the games ""stranded deep"", ""green hell"" and ""the forest"", you could realisticly use any tool for any job, but some are better than others. in green hell, you could throw a rock at a coconut up in a tree, then, whack it with a makeshift slate stone knife to scrape off the top, and bust it open to get the water, and delicious coconut bits. in THIS game, you need an axe to cut down the whole tree just to get the coconut. theres no real depth to anything other than ""have you fished enough of the material to make the item for this? yes? heres a super low durability tool for that that will break in 5 minutes. no? then perish."" instead of giving you multiple options to problems, and letting the player decide how to handle it, theres ONE solution, and its super uninteresting to do. i reccomend green hell or the forest. stranded deep is kinda meh but the other 2 are good.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Temmuz 2022I'm getting sick and tired of games being so lazy that they can't bother to teach you the basics.OK great, I spawned on a raft. Can I move the raft? Seemingly not.Can I grab the items i see littered around me with the grappling hook i have? Nope.So seemingly all I am able to do (if this is incorrect, competent devs would tell their players what to do...) is jump in the water (and lose access to my raft in the process) and grab the items that way. So now i'm stranded in the water with sharks with no means to fight? Yeah awesome, thanks so much guys.Let's also not ignore that the game's loading times (it is a 6GB game ffs) is absurdly slow: it takes longer to load than Elden Ring (no joke) and that game was so poorly optimized and even then, that game is 50 GB with recent graphics.",N/A

And i know that i only played for an hour and in a way the game becomes interesting with the story and all but i hope in the future the game changes the early paste (Since it is what you do all the time) and makes it more exciting with more ways of occupying your mind while playing.Also, where do they keep the melons?",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 OcakIt's a game of micromanagement. Tools are far too fragile (endgame tools seem about twice as durable as the mid game tools but require incredibly rare materials) and players have incredibly high metabolisms. This is annoying by itself, but it gets worse in co-op. Two players works okay, but adding a third puts a massive drain on resources. Someone has to be dedicated to making sure there is enough food and water and it's highly likely at least one player is going to have to go without tools whenever you reach a new tier because the game doesn't increase the availability of resources to deal with the amount of resources required to (repeatedly) remake fragile tools for extra players. The combat is very bad as well but I'd forgive it that if it wasn't for the other issues. The story levels get interesting towards the end but they suffer from asset reuse that makes navigation a huge pain. Raft doesn't do anything better than other games in the genre.",N/A

I'd save my review, but I don't think they're going to take the game in the direction I wish it would go by the time it leaves early access. There are more gameplay mechanics that ruin your fun than there are ones that are fun. The only ones that are fun is building stuff and exploring, but both of those activities are constantly and relentlessly hampered by the games survival mechanics. And I was playing on easy.I had to download mods in order to get even a slight ounce of fun out of the game. I disabled hunger and thirst, and then injuries because the shark is game breakingly annoying. I HAD to do this because the only game mode that disables these things is 'craetive' which also just gives you infinite resources, which makes the game pointless to play. I'd like a mode where I can play the game without having to juggle 4 meters that ultimately kill me (food health water and oxygen).This game could stand to take a few lessons from Subnautica, for sure.EDIT: Oh, and for the love of god--please add controller support.

"Yayınlanma: 9 Mayıs 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiPretty bare bones. A very short and mildly interesting story. Great concept though. Took me 3 hours to visit every island type and realize they're just copy and pasted, which is odd because the islands are so poorly designed that at first you'd think it was randomly generated. All the enemies can all be dominated simply by slowly manipulating W, A, S, D and then poking your foe with a spear. Easy difficulty is far too easy, but then normal is a great deal harder and involves a much higher level of tedium as you spend 30% of your in-game time managing your ever-deteriorating hunger and thirst. Updates are very few and far between and provide a dismal amount of content. Took me 5 hours to completely research all the non-story items in the tech tree. Took me 11 hours to complete the story and realize that there are other things that demand my attention and that I am falling behind my peers as I continue to waste valuable time on video games that I do not even enjoy.",N/A

Damn shark won't let you get close to the water to think about salvaging scrap, and you need scrap to get far enough to do anything.  stupid AF.  Doubtful i'd be able to get a refund, out the $20 for another crap early access title.Update:  Gave the game another go with Mods... million times better and more fun when you can use a mode to just disable the stupid shark.  Now you can actually make progress, with plenty more to hurt you but not be annoying in the process.  I think the original game just needs to have some more features to allow for different difficulties without bruce the shark , etc.  I retract my need for refund statement, but still think this needs further development before i'd want this leaving early access.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 22 Ağustos 2022Pros+ Physics.Cons- Hunger and thirst drains extremely fast, even with end-game food and drink bonuses, which is frustrating.- All features are as deep as a puddle, making the game very tedious and boring.- No procedural generated islands, you see the same ones over and over.- Recipes that require to be found to be unlocked, can easily be found in a matter of hours.- The rest of the recipes are obtained via the story, which makes it pointless being there is no reason to play after you beat the game.Wasn't a fan of this game at all. It's more of a exploration and puzzle game than a survival one. In which case, I'd recommend Sea of Thieves instead. As for the survival aspects, this is potentially the worst I've ever played.

"Yayınlanma: 27 Haziran 2022This game was entirely unfun. Resource costs are too high and right from the get go it feels like a complete grindfest. I played on normal difficulty and was out of food by the end of the first day; consuming a potato , four watermelons and three trees worth of coconuts and mangoes. With no food left on the island and a dwindling health bar my only option was to kill the shark. This proved to be impossible within the amount of hunger I had left, and the shark seemed to tank my spear hits indefinitely. My last spear broke and I had no more planks and no way of getting any without leaving the island which I had yet to even loot around because of the big dumb shark (A big dumb shark that apparently has infinite respawns? killing that thing over and over to loot stone for 3 minutes sounds mind-numbingly boring). I have no idea why my character has such a voracious appetite? Is it part of the story? does he suffer from an intestinal worm? perhaps an entire colony of them?

I got killed by the shark multiple times when starting out, because I couldn't swim to my raft and maneuver myself on. Using the hook was impossible, and positioning myself on the edge of the raft to pick up items flowing by was so bad with the framerate I couldn't get the tooltip that to pick up the item to show up, I just had to mash e hoping the game would pick it up.

"Yayınlanma: 20 Mayıs 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiFor future customers to consider:- Save on death & loose everything you had on you! (yes it is a *feature*)- Halfway through the game you start GRINDING worse then in a pay for play or free to play game mmo.- graphics are nice but nothing spectacular, not worth it to ""sit and watch""- mechanisms are very dodgy and unintuitive, you have to discover what the commands are including how to unfold your inventory!?- it is very very taxing if you make a mistake like eat a raw fish instead of putting it on the grill or drinking salt water instead of pouring it into the purifier - no ux design what so ever! (to devs: This is not a skill based game you morons!)- mechanics are halfa$$ed and the game give off the feeling of unfinished & and unpolished (For instance the shark attacks seem to happen timed rather then pattern based so you can avoid them or anything)If this game was free to play then it would be ok, but for a game you play to enjoy yourself or time with your friends this thing isn't worth the money! The devs got lazy and instead of weaving a narrative and letting the player explore and discover like a sandbox type of game they changed course into a slight story mode but because the game would have been waaay to short in that case they added loads of danger and loads of grinding to make it seem like a longer game.Conclusion: free to play android type of game without any of the fun.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 20 Temmuz 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI do not recommend raft for a few reasons.- Many say that ""If you enjoy games like minecraft, you will love raft"". This is wrong. In games like Minecraft, you can explore freely and go wherever you want. In raft, you have togrind for hours to make any progress, this includes being able to explore. For the first few hours, expect to be confined to your tiny raft.- The item collection mechanics get old real quick. In concept, using your hook to get materials is a fun mechanic, in gameplay,you will end up trying forever to get any material, because of how badly the hook controls.- Have a problem, like no food? Get ready to deal with it until you can fix it. It is very rare to get food with your hook, soyou will have to put up with problems like the shark or dying to hunger every 20 minutes until you grind enough to fix them- Want to explore an island? You cant.You cant go to an island until you spend hours getting an anchor, a sail, and most likely a paddle as wellI wanted to love raft so badly, but even in multiplayer the game is boring as ♥♥♥♥♥, and it takes forever to make any progress",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 8 Mart 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI am not sure if the game is any good. I spent 15 mins in the game and was attacked by a shark 3 times. Left my raft and was stranded on island.

If you have a phobia of sharks like I do, DO NOT, and I mean  DO NOT play this game. I played for 15 mins and almost had a heart attack. My doctors says I may have a heart murmur now.Best of luck if you don't heed my advice.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 21 Haziran 2022Didn't click for me. The fact that your raft is the center of gameplay area and if you lose your raft you're effectively perma-dead (can't build another one) seems very lazy. It would be entirely logical to be able to build another one if you're on an island, have the necessary tools and necessary materials. How did you build the initial raft in the first place? It’s lazy development, centering the play area around the initial raft and not being able to build another one. Many games have this mechanic implemented correctly.Yeah, the game is called Raft and most stuff should revolve around it, I’m not arguing against it, but that’s not the point. Point is that you shouldn’t take unrealistic and illogical shortcuts to make the development easier.And it’s not only that, there’s the mechanic that you collect most important materials only by drifting through the ocean and collecting stuff… what kind of an ocean is that in which every 5 seconds there’s a barrel to hook in, plastics everywhere, wood, leaves… it’s like an aftermath of a tsunami. You’re actually safer on the raft because in the open ocean you have all the necessary materials to survive, but when you’re exploring an island, you are actually less safe cause there’s no crucial materials needed to make tools, purifiers, cups, etc.Then there’s – to avoid being bitten by a shark you jump (??) out of the water? And the shark only follows the raft, not you, and it instantly teleports to bite you the second you drop into the water. Seagulls penetrate closed rooms to get to your plants. Birds on an island throw rocks at you and kill you if you stay long enough?It all seems very unrealistic. I know it’s a small 3-man development team so you can’t expect miracles, but this is too much for a positive review.",N/A

The game starts you off on a raft and floats you around freely. A friendly shark follows you around and tries to eat you at every chance it gets. It eventually will eat your little raft, leaving ou stranded to die in the middle of the ocean, But wait, once you find an island, you can get on it, But dont expect to stay there for long because it will disappear from underneath you and throw you back in the ocean, turning you into shark lunch.

"Yayınlanma: 23 Haziran 2021hey its me, famed steam video game reviewer yung swingset back with another review. in this review, im going to paint a picture for you. youre on a raft. yeah thats right, a raft. its the name of the video game. youre on the raft that the game is named after. the raft isnt very big. its pretty small actually, never figured out how to unlock bigger rafts. so the raft moves right? it moves a lot. it moves like crazy. and for no reason too. like it just starts moving and youre like what the heck. you know why is this raft moving is what you are saying. and the raft is actually moving because of the ocean. the ocean is moving so the raft is moving too. so anyway thats the review.i rate this game (raft (2018)) 3 stars out of a possible 17 stars. thats a pretty bad review of a game is probably what youre saying. and you would be right. thats a scathing review of a game. definitely not good. just not much to do in the game. you just hang out on a raft like why would i play that. i was on that tiny raft for 0.6 hours. 0.6 hours. now you might be thinking that thats not a long time, but im no seaman. 0.6 hours on the wide open sea was a long time. felt like an eternity. i think the game would be drastically improved if you didnt start in the ocean. the ocean is pretty boring except for the sharks and stuff. but if you started in like chicago for example that would be pretty cool. like imagine just starting in chicago and then like a tornado or something carries you all the way out to sea. that would be pretty crazy. if you started in chicago i would rate this game like 13 stars out of a possible 17 stars. but you dont start in chicago you start in the ocean. missed opportunity if you ask me. i think that you should start in chicago. but yeah the final star count is 3 stars out of a possible 17 stars. you just vibe on a raft until you fall and lose the raft. not a great game.thanks for reading my review, means a lot. you didnt have to read it but you decided to anyway which is pretty cool. so yeah thats it. thats the review. let me know what you think about the whole chicago idea. i think its pretty solid. pretty great. but yeah thats it. thats the review.yung swingset out.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 18 Ağustos 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesi5/10.Gameplay is okeish, it's original, it has potential, my main problem is that it runs bad. It's another indie Unity school project or that's how it feels at least. I wish indie devs would leave Unity for what is it; mobile games -- and use a real game engine like UE4 / 5 AND learn more about optimizing your games. There are tons of free educational videos of that for UE4 and 5.Anyway, ss soon as the night falls I have to lower settings even lower than they already are. Gpu is always at over 90% in 4K, that's more than Forza, Red Dead, GTA, Borderlands 3, etc but here there's only a tiny house and water around me to be rendered. Absolutely terrible.Performance video in 4K (still processing at the time of writing):YouTube™ Videosu:Raft // Gameplay // - 4K 60fps, Nvidia RTX 2080FEİzlenme: 525Performs horrible, especially at night.

"Yayınlanma: 31 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiLike too many survival games, it's high on difficulty, low on information, weak on realism and overly complex.  First death... ran out of water.  In a single day died of thirst.  Didn't make it to see my second moon rise.  I died trying to figure out how to make fire (to power the water purifier).  Of course, you don't need fire.  Just pour salt water in, the fire lights automatically... doh.  Died next trying to fish for food.  Took 2 days to die fo starvation, even after eating a few raddishes or whatever they were.  But, I lost about 25 fish before I died.  Every time one bites, the computer says LMB to use the left mouse button, but all that does is instantly recover the line, losing the fish.  If I don't push anything, the fish gets away, push LMB, it instantly gets away.  25 in a row.  I suppose if I made a fishing pole first, before anything else, I could fish 50 times before dying of thirst.  Would I catch one?Tried exploring the islands, but you can't anchor, or even stop on one that I've been able to detect.  Sigh.  Nor can you salvage nearby floating rafts.  They look exactly like yours, but, you are allowed the one recoverable item (the ice chest) then it starts to sink.  Should look different, if it behaves differently.Just doesn't seem rewarding.  I'm sure if you get past the early death hump, it might become fun, but it was so frustrating, and not seeing a way past starvation right now, I have little desire.  Also, it's basically an infinaite series of hooking wood and plastic and leaves.  That's it.  That's your resource.  I found some metal at a reef, some glass.  Fine.  But, you have to constantly work to hook those resources, while making sure you can build more raft to protect your items from sharks, get the water purifier up and running, and SOMEHOW get food (assuming fishing actually works... 25 and 0 tells me it doesn't).I can't imagine actually getting to the point to build a larger two decker raft and paint it, like in the movie.  Nor can I imagine the patience or amount of hooking of floating trash it would require.  Neat idea.  You got my $20, for a couple of hours of abject frustration, and zero desire to ever try again.  A win?",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Haziran 2018Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiErken Erişim İncelemesiI was greatly mislead by the videos and screenshots of this game.  I was lead to believe it was a multiplayer title.  But so far you start off on your own, just learning how the game works.There is no multiplayer function beyond inviting friends online to play.  But that's only IF they have the game.  There are no servers to join or other players to hang out with.Everything else about the game is a lot of fun, like the shark gnawing at your raft as you expand it to hooking in the scraps of trash floating by to build your raft/home.But it's greatest dissapointment is the lack of a multiplayer system beyond inviting friends on.PROS> Gameplay> art style> Game ideaCONS> no multiplayer servers",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Temmuz 2022🚫🌭Not Hotdog 🚫🌭Follow my curator page'Hotdog or Not Hotdog'if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.If I think the game is good, it gets a 🌭Hotdog🌭. If it's not, it gets 🚫🌭Not Hotdog🚫🌭.The game is ok, but it feels quite shallow (pardon the pun). Very addicting at first but the game becomes less stellar the more you play. The gameplay loop, while fun at first, leaves a lot to be desired.There are a few annoying small things that become more noticeable over time such as;* No repair function/table for items.* Bowls and drinking glasses are consumed instead of re-usable for some reason.* There are non-plantable flora such as berries, mushrooms and chili.* Plant seeds aren't always sustainable.* Lack of variety of catchable fish, both small and large.* Having to gather underwater with the hook instead of just picking it up with your hands.The game really needs more balance in terms of durability and/or crafting cost. The hook and axe have 2 upgrades, but the fishing rod only has 1. Armor doesn't have any upgrades. Same with Flippers , Oxygen Tank and the Bow. The reason to have these upgrades, like with the Axe, is to increase the durability which, in itself, isn't balanced right now. Doesn't really make sense you can create better quality building parts (which does add durability as well as better aesthetics) but you can't do the same with other things such as the above mentioned.You can create something as advanced as circuit boards and batteries but the available technology is quite primitive. There seems to be a fair few number of items that should be in the game but aren't. Solar panels, anyone??The variety of islands is laughable and extremely lackluster. These really should have been procedurally generated to create hundreds, if not thousands of permutations. I have no idea why it wasn't, but I'm not a game dev of this engine.The trading outpost on islands is such a waste of potential.Overall, ""Waste of potential"" is how I would describe this game. It scratched that Open World/Survival/Craft itch for a while, but the glaring omissions and lacking depth (I did it again) makes it frustrating to play and recommend. After 63 hours in about 4 days (more like 50 hours or so with the amount of time in the main menu or paused), I just lack the motivation to play anymore.Dealing with all (and I mean probably ALL) of the things mentioned above would greatly increase the playability of the game and they're basic enough things that I honestly feel like there really isn't a reason why they shouldn't be added IMO. Hopefully these things are addressed and 1.0 isn't the final content update.I would rate the game more neutral than negative or positive, but steam lacks the technology to add that functionality to reviews.I got my money's worth (15% off), but wait for a bigger sale I think.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 4 NisanCompletionist info at the bottom. Mild spoilers in this review. Rating 6/10Raft, fundamentally, has an interesting concept. It is a survival/crafter except the player is stuck on a plank of wood in the middle of the ocean with no world to explore. At the beginning, you have nothing to use and you must subsist off of planks, plastic, and leaves picked up from ocean waves. These materials can then be used to craft better items, including a much needed fishing rod for food, water purifier for thirst, and spear for protection against the ever-present shark. Oh yeah, there is also a shark nearby the player’s raft at all times, biting and injuring the player who happens to fall off and occasionally destroying part of the raft if not attacked in time. I think that this core concept is great. It is the thing that makes Raft a fun game to play. It is rewarding to progress from a little Raft to a steadily growing one, rewarding to not have to struggle any longer to keep from running out of food, and rewarding to create a little livable space out of your raft.Progression continues in Raft with the discovery of small and then large islands. Both of these, I think, add a great depth of gameplay to the game. New materials, most importantly, seaweed and iron ore, can be found at these locations and these, in turn, can be used to craft better and better tools, weapons, and buildings. It gives the player something to do and explore and it gives the game a natural pattern of activity. Work on your raft for a little bit. Figure out food and water for the next while. Go explore a nearby island. Repeat. This pattern is great, and it’s this excellent foundation that I really wish the game had built upon with its subsequent updates.Unfortunately, Raft did not. Raft, instead of expanding upon its core mechanics, adding new materials and recipes, or encouraging the player to build bigger and better rafts, goes full-steam ahead with its story. There are a few major problems with this approach:1.	Raft’s actual movement mechanics are not great. The game controls are janky to state it kindly. You cannot move fast, action and combat is slow, it is hard to judge exactly how far away you are from things, and jumping allows you to scale walls which should clearly not be scalable. The thing is, none of this really matters when you are on a raft. The mechanics work great in that environment as the player accomplishes his tasks. Also, in water, where you’ll spend a significant amount of time resource gathering, the mechanics seem to be a bit more intuitive to control. Where the controls are shown to be rather uninteresting, plain, and difficult to get used to, however, is on giant islands and in combat, both of which are found in abundance in the game’s story. These different locations are simply not fun to play through and the exceptionally large ones (looking at you Balboa island) wear out their welcome quickly.2.	Raft almost exclusively uses environmental storytelling and notes to tell its story. The player has a journal where notes can be kept and read through after all of them have been collected, but that’s just the point, the notes don’t even have to be collected. These stories almost seemed tacked on to the locations, giving the player a couple of extra incentives to really explore each area. But unless you are very intrinsically motivated, this task is not likely to appeal you. This is due to the fact that most of the story just doesn’t matter. Little details can be gleaned and there are a few interesting overarching plots from island to island, but, for the most part, the stories are either self-contained or only vaguely applicable to the greater narrative. The narrative is just not strong enough to make up for how much of a time sink it is.3.	Raft hides its best equipment behind the story. All end-game items are obtained by picking up crafting blueprints found throughout the story (which can be missed). So, even the player who just wishes to play Raft as a purely survival/crafter must slog through about ten hours of story just to get the best equipment for his raft. With the story being what it is, this is just not a decision I think was wise. On one hand, I understand wanting to reward the player who experiences the story, but I think the penalties are too harsh for those who do not wish to do so. Imagine if, in Minecraft, you just couldn’t find diamonds until you saw the credits. That’s basically what Raft does with some of its materials and buildings.Overall then, I think Raft has a solid base of gameplay; it has exploration and crafting with fitting graphics all contained in a unique concept - you are stuck on a raft. Unfortunately, I think the game suffers by trying to be what it is not, a story-focused game. By hiding progression behind visiting and exploring a series of (mostly) above-ground islands, the game’s weaknesses in design are on full-display. And the shame is, the story is not awful or anything, it just doesn’t quite fit, and I can’t help but wonder what the team might have accomplished if they had focused on the parts of Raft which drew so many people to it in the first place, the surviving and the crafting.Completionist Information: (Difficulty – 5/10)(Fun – 2/10)(Time: 80-100 hours)Raft is not really a hard game and once the player is out of the early game, starving and dehydration can be pretty much eliminated completely. I played through the entirety of Raft’s story and collected all notes, tikis, paintings, and blueprints, all of which you will need to do if you wish to complete this game.The main thing completing Raft is, is boring. There are a lot of “kill x number of this” or “do this x number of times” and it is very time consuming. Checking Steam completion statistics and it is not surprising that so few people have collected many of this games achievements. The worst achievements are the one’s for finding every painting and tiki, both of which are random drops from a late game item. These two tasks alone could take 5-10 hours (although the paintings can be save-scummed somewhat).On top of this, you must play Raft for a set amount of days, which ended up being about 92 hours for me. You can speed this up by sleeping as soon as it is night, but other than that, there is no way to make this faster. I ending up AFKing after collecting every other achievement for maybe 15-20 hours to get this one.Overall, not a fun game to complete at all. It isn’t hard or challenging in any way, just painfully monotonous and unrewarding. There is a crazy amount of grind needed and, as islands, animals, and the-like can only be discovered periodically, the game is just not conducive towards the playstyle that is required to achieve completion.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Nisani was pretty tepid about this game honestly, and ended up getting so bored with the story and gameplay that i kept going afk on the boat and letting others do the playing.the gimmick of ""survival craft but boat"" and ""in raft, stuff comes to *you*"" while gathering is entertaining for awhile, but gets boring quicklywhen mixed with game mechanics such as ""wonky arrowsponge bird drops big rock and flies behind cliffs to reload"" and ""bear is angry that you did not complete berry puzzle"", along with the unendingly janky animations this game showcases, i find it hard to recommend to anyone in light of other more polished survival craft gamesyou might find the story far more entertaining than i did, there is that. i found it tedious and difficult to care about the characters.one thing i will say was very excellent about this game was its ui and the user friendliness and ease of crafting it presented, many survival craft games could learn from raft in that regard",N/A

Yayınlanma: 30 MartFor a survival game there sure are better options out there. The game does everything it can to waste your time. Some good ideas but badly implemented,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 NisanYes, I played through the whole game. No, it was not worth it.While the concept of Raft is fun, the implementation of most of the game was horribly done. The pacing of the story was irrelevant, resource management was way too intensive and all of the advanced tools came too late in the story for me to bother making them. Even if I wanted to, there is not enough titanium added to the game to actually utilize the advanced tools in any meaningful way. Not to mention the fact that any of the quality of life tools (i.e. the oxygen bottle, the headlamp, the flippers) continually wear out while they're being worn whether you're using them or not. In addition, these quality of life tools wear down waaaayyyyyy too quickly to be worth the amount of effort and resources it takes to make them.3/10...would not recommend.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 NisanThis game is great fun until it's dragged to a halt by absolutely terribly designed puzzles. I want to sail the seas, hunt down treasures and materials, craft new parts of my raft,  and figure out the mysteries of the story, not spend a frustrating amount of time having to play amateur plumber and electrician in some absolutely awful puzzles made by someone who definitely hates fun. This game should have stuck to what made it enjoyable rather than trying to be Legend of Zelda: Windwaker with more sharks. I had to stop playing right near the end because I just couldn't take it anymore.Get it on sale if you want, but don't expect to finish the story unless you want to go insane trying to complete puzzles created by a misanthropic psychopath.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 NisanA very good idea with poor execution. While I do recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival / exploration games it is a very difficult game for most. It is NOT fair or relaxing and has many flaws.Pros:- Entertaining building mechanics- Fun story and exploration- Decent modding sceneCons:- Unbalanced gameplay loop- Unnecessarily punishing mechanics- Poorly designed crafting mechanics / recipes- Many bugs / issues with resource management- Unrealistically hostile environment- High stress due to rapid food / thirst timers- Unapparent or hidden mechanics that negatively affect the player for no clear reason.- Slow progression with heavy losses- Unbalanced combat with few options for counter-play / strategy.- Unpolished visuals / animations- Poor sound design- High system stress for a low quality game- Unimaginative / Unrealistic interactions exist purely to disadvantage the player- Unapparent direction for story progression requiring constant focus and attention to tiny detail with no basis for organic progression- Generally unrewarding gameplay- Lack of content to break normal gameplay loop- Generally frustrating death mechanics and inventory / item managementIn essence this game is fun. I wouldn't have played it as much if it weren't. However without mods I would not have played it and stopped immediately. Multiplayer definitely makes the game more fun but even then I still can't see myself ever playing it without mods. There are too many issues that will never be fixed. The developers seem not to care about polish or balance and focus instead on getting it to a ""complete"" state so it can be priced as a full game. While I'm not holding this against them in any way, it's clear they have little passion for game development.Play it. It's fun. Make your own judgments.Edit: After finishing the story I am left with a disgusting taste of disappointment in my mouth. I thought perhaps the story would yield something of interest but instead it ends like a dead fish. Stinky and unappetizing. It yields nothing of note that is useful or fun beyond ""Good Job!"" and genuinely made me not want to continue playing any more. Somehow the story actually made the entire game less fun.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 5 MartRaft is a very well received game and many people seem to enjoy it, and I'm probably simply not giving it a proper chance.For me, the initial gameplay loop of trying to fish as much stuff out of the ocean (leaves/plastic/wood, YAY a barrel!) while making sure I don't die of thirst and hunger is no fun to me.

Normally I don't buy games that only work with keyboard, but this was gifted to me by a friend and a couple years back I had thought the devs were working on Controller compatibility from something that they had said. I love this game, I watch countless videos on it, but I would love to see accessibility for more people who can't stretch their fingers all the way or comfortably hold a mouse. I only don't recommend on the basis that there aren't more accessibility features and that does lock some people from being able to play it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 28 ŞubatTl;dr: Game's OK I guess, but it isn't something I will actively recommend others to try, as the game gets somewhat boring after the early game. I also feel that some of the gameplay elements are not suitable for this game and feels out of place.Raft is an open-world survival sandbox where the players are dropped into an endless ocean and have to scavenge food & materials, build up their raft, and travel the flooded world to find out about the story and people of this world.Gameplay: The basic gameplay loop is: Collect resources - craft gear/tools from available blueprint - use gear/tool to explore the world for higher tier blueprints and story - gather higher tier resources for the new blueprints - build these new gears/tools - explore for higher tier stuff or story again (so on and so forth).This gameplay loop works fine in the beginning, but for me it starts to break apart from midgame onwards. I think I can name a few factors that contribute to this experience:First, the stuff you can build are very front-loaded, meaning you get showered in new stuff to build at the beginning of the game, but once you have all the basic blueprints built, you really just cannot build much else that matters except for the stuff strictly needed for progression. Therefore, the mid-to-late game can feel a bit detached from the build-heavy experience you have in the beginning.Second, perhaps in service of presenting the story of this flooded world, the gameplay also shifts focus from exploring an open world and minor combat to puzzle solving and platforming. Despite being an open-world game, the level design of the story locations feels somewhat linear, with 4 out of 7 major story (The 1st, 2nd, 6th, & 7th) locations being linear stages, not really having different routes to the goal. The late game also amps up the platforming challenge, but the camera and controls (or floor detection) really do not feel like it is made for these in mind. It feels like the artistic vision of the game came into conflict with the gameplay, which is already made.Third, the combat is... lackluster. In the early game you do not do a lot of it, but that will change as you progress in story. You don't have a lot of weapon variety (a grand total of 3 weapon types, plus throwing rocks if you count that), and there is just not a lot of enemies except like 5 types of hostile wildlife and reskinned versions of them. The combat also boils down to kiting if you use a bow, or simple movement around the enemy if you use any melee weapon.Music/Sound design: Good. The number of tracks might be on the low side, with no biome or story-location specific theme (except the boss theme), but the soundtrack does not intrude the player's experience and makes you feel immersed in this sea-world.Graphics/Visual design: I don't think I'm qualified to talk about graphics, as I played this game on a underpowered laptop that lags if I put it anywhere above 720p and the minimum graphic settings. Artstyle however is pretty good - slightly cartoonish and very bright, makes you feel like you are on a vacation to a seaside resort and lightens your mood. I will nitpick that the lighting is weird - you generally have the lowest visibility at dawn and dusk, not midnight. This is because most items that you can interact with will glow a bit at night, but not at dawn or dusk. Maybe making it this way reduces the frustration of not seeing anything at night, but it just made navigating the world at dawn/dusk all the more annoying.Difficulty: The early game is very manageable on the two lower difficulties, even if you play by yourself. I have not tried the hardest difficulty, nor have I played the end game in single player, but I feel that some sections in the late game can be fairly annoying to deal with on higher difficulty and while playing alone.In conclusion, while I think the early game exploration/crafting is great, I honestly disagree with the 93% steam recommendation at the time I wrote this review, especially because the game gets worse as it goes on.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 27 ŞubatThe gameplay feels really clunky, the combat especially.The early game is incredibly tedious with how little food/water items restore, and how much of them you need. Having to build spears constantly, or replace chunks of your raft constantly is also incredibly boring.You end up replacing your tools every few minutes it seems like, and most of them are super cost prohibitive to craft early on.  A wooden spear is 6 palm leaves (3 rope) and 8 planks to craft.  You technically need two to kill the shark, which gives you a few minutes of shark free time. So basically 16 planks, and 12 palm leaves. You can ignore the shark, and use shark baits, but you have to fish for the baits. And that is 6 planks, and 8 ropes (16 palm leaves) and you aren't guaranteed to get the fish you need. And it only has 10 uses before it breaks (the fishing pole).Every palm leaf/ plank is a fair amount of time to get, mostly because you generally reel them in one at a time mostly. Overall it doesn't feel fun, or rewarding to me. Feels like a huge waste of time.You do eventually get some things to make it easier, but overall the game is incredibly grindy and boring to me. You might enjoy it, it's not a bad game or anything. I just wouldn't recommend it, and I didn't enjoy it.I re-downloaded it and tried a few more hours at the urging of a friend and just sort of reconfirmed everything in terms of why I didn't like it in the first place.Overall:Clunky movementClunky interactions and hotkeysVery very grindy until you get further in the game than I feel like personally going.Everything is very time consuming, not something you can really just pop on for a bit and play.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 26 ŞubatI would love to recommend this game to you, but I WILL NOT.This is NOT because the game has bad premise (it is a good premise).This is NOT because the story isn't compelling (it is compelling).This is NOT because the core gameplay isn't fun (it is fun).It is because there are some glaring problems that the Devs have shown zero interest in actually fixing.1. Optimisations2. Seagulls are OP brutal when away from the raft===Optimisations:I purchased the game in Early Access May 5 2020. And I am fully aware that EA should be expected to be a ""Beta"" version of whatever game is the topic. However, between now and then, the amount of people complaining about a need/requirement for optimisations in this game has done nothing but increased.And what have the Devs done? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT OPTIMISATIONS.a) I cannot find any examples of the Devs acknowledging there are optimisation problemsb) I cannot find ANY patch notes talking about any optimisations to any significant degree since I bought the game (even since it went 1.0) :https://steamdb.info/app/648800/patchnotes/Now, I'm not talking about ""this game really should run better"". I'm talking about the fact I have a BEEFCAKE computer, that is MANY TIMES faster than their ""Recommended"" requirements, and many scenes I get 40-60 FPS, and in one case I literally ran out of VRAM and was getting 4FPS. DESPITE HAVING WAY MORE VRAM THAN WAS RECOMMENDED BY A LOT.Let's take a look at the listed hardware details for this game:Minimum:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 or laterProcessor: Intel Core i5 2.6GHz or similarMemory: 6 GB RAMGraphics: GeForce GTX 700 series or similarDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 10 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: 64-bit operating system is requiredRecommended:Requires a 64-bit processor and operating systemOS: Windows 7 or laterProcessor: Intel Core i5-6600 3.3GHz or similarMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: GeForce GTX 1050 series or similarDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 10 GB available spaceAdditional Notes: 64-bit operating system is requiredMY SPECS:CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800xRAM: 32GBGraphics: GeForce RTX 3060 tiNow, let's take a look at the comparison between my CPU and GPU vs the recommended...Recommended, i5-6600, Passmark Total 6042, Single Threaded 2263My CPU Ryzen 7 5800x: Passmark Total 28080. Single Threaded 3447Recommended GeForce GTX 1050, Passmark 5051My GPU GeForce RTX 3060 ti, Passmark 20572 (also, 8GB VRAM)So...1. My CPU is literally 4.647x faster for multi-threaded workloads, and 1.523x faster for single-threaded workloads (than the recommended CPU)2. My GPU is literally 4.072x faster (than the recommended CPU)There is ABSOLUTELY ZERO REASON I SHOULD BE GETTING THE PERFORMANCE I GET.Now, I know for a fact the optimisations that they could implement are low-hanging fruit, because when I start going near an area I haven't explored in, my FPS drops as my game is literally rendering things BEHIND WALLS THAT I CANNOT SEE. This is a problem that has been solved LITERALLY DECADES AGO, by not having games render things THE PLAYER CANNOT SEE, EVEN BEHIND WALLS.And this is just one of so many optimisations the devs literally will not do, won't even talk to, and we have zero indication they even actually care about.This one aspect alone has made me want to fully rage quit this game so many times.===Seagulls are OP brutal when away from the raft, and rafts render while you're away, no matter how far you are away.I have been continuing my coop game with my SO that we've been playing on and off since May 5 2020, as we've been playing through the content it comes out. And we just got to an ice island as part of the later game content.The ice island has a lot to do on it, lots of running around. But guess what we found when we came back? ALL OF THE PLANTED FOOD WAS GONE AND ALL OF OUR ANIMALS WERE ALMOST DEAD.Why did this happen? Because:a) the game continues to render and process the raft no matter how far away you are from it (even if you lost render distance 40 minutes ago or more)b) seagulls are RELENTLESS BEASTS THAT WILL ALWAYS EAT YOUR FOOD NO MATTER WHATThis literally punishes us for PLAYING THE GAME HOW IT WAS INTENDED. I think it is completely unreasonable to be like this, because the only way I can actually guard against this is to:a) never leave the raft (or)b) place 20,000,000 scarecrowsc) place 20,000,000 food waterers (forget the exact name)Because quite frankly, we shouldn't have to worry about how our raft is doing when we're away, especially on very large islands with lots to do on them. This punishes the player, and really makes me not only never want to plant crops again, but not play any more.===So no. I WILL NOT recommend this game.I will probably beat this game with my SO, we're so close, promptly uninstall, and hide this game from my library.Not because I don't love it, but because the developers intentionally avoid doing any optimisations (and I genuinely cannot believe they've never read one of the MANY optimisation threads out there), and somehow don't care whatsoever about how seagulls or your raft go on while you're so far away from it.A lot of this game does deserve good ratings, but with how absolutely trash optimised this game is, it doesn't realistically deserve more than a 40% rating IMO.I have a beast computer, and I can barely play this game. What is someone who actually complies with the ""Recommended"" settings supposed to do when they get far less FPS?And it seems like the Devs have really just abandoned this game. Their website still has copyright 2020 on it. And I see no evidence they're doing more than just occasional hotfixes for extreme cases.Don't buy this game.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 20 Şubatwith friend this game wont be so bad but seems very limited and playing solo dont seem fun at most islands are not that amazing doesnt have that adventure vibe for me seems random gen islands some so small no point having checking it out apparently every things needs rope to craft and rare that item to get died like 4 time from starving death and every time u die u lose half your inventory feels like being divorce every time u die and food dont really fill you up at all and needs water/food way to fast kind of gets annoying not giving yo the chance to explore or build things because so busy looking for food every 5 min smh and weapons well lol not much game look nice but having to keep repairing your raft needing recycle plastic every time just to repair and getting stalk by that one shark that keeps following you destroying your raft like murderer a bit annoying see a lot of open water full trash in the water over and over again repetitive lack of diverse in this game overall 2.5 out 5 game lacks a lot compared to other survival games i didnt find it that fun,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 19 Şubathonestly, maybe fun for an hour or two with friends, but you will soon find out its gameplay loop is actually lackluster and boring, crafting is not fun its tedious, having to constantly repair your ship b/c sharks attack your raft basically on a timer, all your meters drain like your running a marathon but all u've done is fend off another shark attack (theres only shark attacks, nothing else). the quest line u follow is dull, unintuitive and boring as it basically comes down to going to a new area, find some stuff to unlock some stuff, repeat. u need wood to make an axe with limited usage to get more wood to build/repair ur raft which is constantly under attack by sharks, meanwhile ur food/water meter drops super fast, its not fun, its a chore. everything is a chore. save urself and ur friends the money and go play barotrauma instead, its way more fun and more well made then this pile or hot garbage cash grab.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 19 Şubatmixed bagplay this game with friends or you are going to be hella boredthe story islands are boring as hec, you collect goofy notes it seems cool at 1st but it seems annoying and stupid when you want to play raft again with a friend like bro i swear this game wants me to commit marathon on balbao island like bro i need to unlock 3 radio towers and get a code which leads to a another story thats 100x more longer then it. ok fr this is a decent game you will get hooked on for 2 months, then forget about it and play it once then forget about it. i am halfway through the story and i quit this game because it feels boring collecting the notes for 19358 hours like bro THIS ISNT FUN COLLECTING NOTES LIKE WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO WALK AROUND IT FOR 10 YEARS JUST TO FIND NOTES BRO I SWEAR I NEED A YOUTUBE TUTORIAL TO GET THROUGH STORY ISLANDS and the story isnt even interestiing for me maybe this game aint for me but theres better things to spend on like food then this game which you will leave after you do the whole story and never touch it. concusion this is  a rigged reveiw play it with friends i dont like this game i feel like i could had bought chicken instead of this crap you will have fun for 2 months but its your choice playing with friends is 100x better i was drunk when i was wirting this reveiw",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 20 ŞubatRaft is so frustratingly close to being a really good game. It has a really good base loop, but all of the important progression is locked behind the story, which would be fine if the story wasn't so poorly designed. It takes you to huge oversized islands with little to no harvestable resources, puzzles that give minimal clues and tanky animals that infinitely respawn. The game isn't designed for this kind of land exploration, and each stop on the story becomes a huge resource sink that disrupts the loop very uncomfortably. If you're planing on playing, use a walkthrough.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 19 ŞubatDifficulty curve is very frustrating. At the beginning of every game you struggle and need good luck.

Yayınlanma: 16 Şubatthis game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks dont buy it,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 16 ŞubatI'd summarize it as... an extremely overwrought mine-craft modpack. Fun enough if you have someone to play with, with a few interesting elements. Feels extremely unfinished/unpolished and some of the game play design elements (esp those in the story) are weirdly outdated (key-fetching dungeons, very silly and obvious platforming). The writing is hilariously bad (though the story itself is neat). Every time I think the game is about to do something interesting, I am met with disappointment. It constantly feels like a squandered premise.That said, the base building is nice and it's novel to have your base with you as you travel, and there's a lot of cool ideas overall. It's repetitive, but in a way that I'd imagine some people would find very relaxing and satisfying. I've had fun playing it so far, and intend to finish the story, but I don't feel like I would recommend the game to anyone else. If you do decide to play, I advise the use of mods.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 ŞubatI have been keeping an eye on raft for awhile, I remember watching my favorite YouTubers playing it a couple years ago, I finally got around to play it recently and I am... disappointed to say the least.Here are some problems I have with this game, having to eat and drink every 5 minutes is absolutely annoying, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound affects drove me crazy and actually pissed me off!Oh and don't even get me started on the slow debuff-Hearing my character ♥♥♥♥♥ every time they are hungry made me want to intentionally have them starve, at least they'd shut up then.Second, the shark always on your ass all the time is a big problem, I get needing sharks in a tropical survival game but... they're a massive nuisance, you can't leave your raft without being attacked!Oh and when you finally manage to kill them they ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ respawn in like 5 minutes or so, you can never escape the torment.Maybe it wouldn't be a problem if the sharks weren't too common?Even though I have played this game for 5 hours I can see that this game is pretty lame and not for me.The game may be finished but it feels like a lot is missing and not going to lie, it did have a lot of potential and no hate on the developers, I know they did their best and I admire them for that.I may come off as a little blunt here but those are my honest thoughts, I wish the developers all the best luck on their future projects!",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 14 ŞubatThe developers of this game straight-up do not care about the player. Very little respect for the player's time and myopic and self-centered design.This shows itself mainly in the ""Standard"" game mode being balanced such the resource depletion the player experiences acts as if the player already knows the game, and while solo means you're constantly scrabbling to keep everything from falling apart, rather than exploring. There are also very few things explained ingame, glitches with things doing two jobs but the second one being hard to find, and lots of long-going processes with no progress bar.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 12 ŞubatAfter seeing reviews and videos comparing this game to subnautica and no man sky, I purchased this game. At first, it was fun. You build your raft, it's fun.

"Yayınlanma: 11 ŞubatOver-hyped and becomes a let-down the longer you play.For some reason, instead of doubling down on the fun and unique (at the time it hit early access) mechanic of building up a raft and crafting with scraps floating in the sea with more raft-based mechanics and game-play, the game swings over into somehow even slower paced walking simulator 'Find X number of X item to progress', laid out in a manner that feels like its obviously just trying to slow you down with a narrative story progression that I can't even remember anything about.The concept of open world survival craft with a story progression is always welcomed and usually quite fun in other games but I don't think it was achieved the best way here. After maybe 10 hours of the exciting 'figuring it out' stage - learning the new crafting elements and building between constantly drinking water and eating - it just becomes boring to the point that its frustrating.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 ŞubatIn many ways this is an amazing game but there is so much added tedium that it feels like a drag to actually develop and build your raft.

"Yayınlanma: 24 OcakAlright so, this is not really a bad review. In simple terms, I found this game terrifying even on peaceful mode. I discovered that I have a fear for the ocean as well as a fear for sharks which doesn't bode well for a game in the ocean with a shark. Point is: if you have a doubt you can handle the game, don't buy it (unless it's on sale, then consider).The controls are kind of unclear and with no tutorial that I could find in the opening menu, I found myself often opening up the control guide and watching walkthroughs to understand what I was doing. This game as no direction aside from 'make this to progress' and only guides can help you figure out how to do that. Now, that may be some people's kind of game, but it's not really my style.The graphics are nice and I like the mechanics of the hook for mats, fishing, farming and exploring the islands. I can get myself turned around often, but I don't have the best sense of direction anyhow. This negative review is in no way a bash at the game as whole but a reference for others who might not like this particular style of game.TLDR/Point: Not my style, but great mechanics, graphics, and from what I've seen from others, a great story to be seen. 6/10",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 23 OcakAside from crafting the raft, the mechanics are tedious and not stimulating. The story was a chore to finish.  Co-op will provide a few hours of joy with friends, possibly more for a casual/inexperienced gamer. Details below:First few session were a blast as we staved off hunger, thirst, and the shark (but the shark got glitched out 20% of the time)Next few sessions: Got the resource management down, and began hunting ""big"" islands for the new resources they made available. Permanently protected the raft from the shark, and gained access to story progression via crafting.The remaining sessions were traveling towards radio signals to unique islands. Each island had a very simple story (each with the same ""twist""), a poorly fleshed/experimental game mechanic, and some fetch quests/minor puzzles. There was often 1 new enemy on a unique island (although many reskins) and a few blueprints to make the raft require less management.The game received ""better with friends"" 2022 steam award, and I can only surmise that this is not due to outstanding achievement, but due to the game being entirely unfun by yourself. All of my joy came from building the raft (first few hours) and then commiserating over the arduous game experience with my friend.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 22 OcakTedious is the name of the game. There's no agency in gathering resources. If you need plastic you need to wait for it to drift by one at a time. If you need rocks you need to wait until you stumble across an island. Collecting items with the hook is annoying more than engaging. Food and water are very simple to solve if you give them time, but impossible to solve on short notice. You're better off ignoring the mechanic entirely and killing yourself after putting your items in chests. I don't want to wait 8 hours for the RNG to give me the materials I need to build a radio and actively start searching for things. I'd refund if I hadn't waited 2 weeks to play.",N/A

The building aspects are pretty good and indepth, but so much the game leaves me with a feeling that I could be spending time doing something more enjoyable or playing better games.Also the combat is very very very very mediocre. I want to add that I played this alone, perhaps with friends, interacting, talking in VC, and planning it's probably a much better experience, but playing on my own just feels kinda tedious.",N/A

(both of us having fiber connection).3: placing the engine,ancor controller on a platform and destroying the platform just strait up deleted the controller, didnt drop, didnt land in the nett, and it didnt even show in my inventory, it just got deleted.4: I didnt even know eating clay bowls and eating glass jars was god for you, but now I know.this I would like to see get changed, cause it doesnt make any sence at all, instead of the bowl and glass get consumed, why not add a new ""waste"" item that you can use in the trash compactor, it doesnt need to provide mch to a scrap cube, but atleast then you get something in return.5: resolution and fps is locked to eachother... why?! I want this to be seperate selection.I got a powerfull PC that can handle everything maxed without any issue, and palying on 60Hz giving me headace due to low FPS and selecting lower resolution to get 144Hz makes the graphic look like absolute crap!6: unable to build the advanced automatic ancor under a normal height roof, even tryed to buil the ancor then add roof over, but nope.7: would love to see a item you can add to your character that shuts engine/sail off, and drops ancor if you fall off the boat so the boat dont chugg off into the distance away from you.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 OcakThey kinda just kept adding stuff with each update and never really ironed out all the issues each one brought. Jumping indoors is still jank, walking animations are still jank, equipping the hook too quickly is jank, I know you can capture the goats and llamas and stuff but killing them should give you SOMETHING, food and hunger deplete way too quickly and most foods (except maybe shark meat and meat (maybe some other rare foods) give you not enough to your meters at all. Why does eating 11 mangoes just about fill me up? I think 2 or 3 should suffice. When you die and you lose 2/3 of your inventory YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND PICK IT UP. Making those items just vanish is just so cruel. When I'm playing solo I have to be so damn careful to not die cuz there is nobody to save me. Building is jank especially when the raft is rocking about. Taking down walls should give you 100% resources back especially when I'm just moving a wall somewhere else. The boar being able to run at light speed down an entire mountain around half the island just to get to you is definitely a bug and should've been patched so long ago. The hook not syncing to the waves when getting loot from the water during a storm is buggy and annoying, When the raft collides with an island it will bug out and start jittering all over the place, I mean the game is called RAFT and even the raft interacting with an island is buggy? Come on... The metal spear is too expensive for its durability, When placing a light source during the day it will light up for a split second every time, Why can't I fish while sitting? Not like I could for long because I get hungry every 5 mins meaning I'll need to find myself 55 mangoes to survive 20-30 mins. I gave this game lots of time to fix itself during early access but after full release I slowly realized that I guess to the devs all of those things were intentional and were never going to be fixed.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 OcakExtremely boring, even in it's own genre where you have to sometimes ""make your own fun"".early game can brick your world by either getting your raft stuck, or dying and running out of your important items, like the mandatory hook which you use to grab resources.midgame is reached after a long time of just mindlessly getting metals and smelting them for way too long and this is the biggest flaw of the game for me, it's an endless loop of, grab resources and wait, the gameplay loop just isn't fun. which is emphasized by the fact the developers put in ""collectors"", nets which do the boring stuff for you, it's not a fun loop grabbing and smelting metals either, it's waiting for something you need too much for per item and what is the final reward? more floating and collecting notes... great.Only recommend this with friends, but anything is fun with friends and if you can stand games where you have ABSOLUTELY no goal, because anyone who thinks the story in this game is worthwhile is quite a lot more easily impressed than me.TL:DR; If i could refund, i would. but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay loop took too long before i could form an opinion.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 OcakUPDATE at 63 hours: The game is crashing when I try to load the world my group is playing. So basically we lost the world. At this point I can t recommend the game anymore but notice that this is not a general problem but happens occassionally. Anyway. When RAFT works is a good experience. After 63 hours I can say I liked the game but if this things happen i cannot recommend it. I will keep it installed and try again in a month to see if they fixed the issue.UPDATE at 62 hours: Still having a blast but what this game excells in crafting it is terrible in platforming. No physics at all in the movement. When you jump if you stop going fordward you stop moving in middle air like willy coyote. It s like copy and pasting on any freaking software but photoshop that has it s own way of doing things and instead of working for you asks you to work with it. We almost succeded after half an hour but rage quit on a frustrating note. We ll give it a try later as we hope this won t be the end of the adventure for us. Still, if it is, I will keep recommending it with a warning. Also the game is laggy as hell the moment you find a big city, so you have to balance platforming with a very poor performance due to bad programming and a terrible platforming system. I still think it is possible but a game like this should not go to this lengths on another genre it truly sucks at.I have to say it, I don t like survival games. The concept of ""reality"" is way overvalued. It is not reality that in 5 minutes I am already hungry and thirsty or that a giant bird, golem or monster attacks me while I gather resources and poop (yeap, I m looking at you ARK Survival Evolved). But what I like of some survival games is the sense of exploration and adventure. Green Hell was a blast to play with a nice story to follow. V rising is the next evolution of Diablo. Valheim is... passable until you meet the mosquitos and rage quit after the third time you died.And then comes this game. This is such a beautiful symphony of adventure and exploration. Understand we are playing it in the easy level where you don t lose anything when you die and you respawn in the raft. Still it s so much fun to discover new recipes, to create stuff, to investigate everything and to fight with the fauna. The shark is a nice menace but controlable (in easy level) which lets you gather resources in the bottom of a coral reef or travel islands and get beaten by a giant bird that throws you rocks. Until you learn how to create a bow and things go... well, exactly the same because we suck at fighting.Yet this game has the perfect balance that makes it enjoyable from the beginning (again in easy level) and after you understood what elements you need to build first... like the gathering nets that get everything from the ocean, the water purifier and the fishing rod, among others.We are 10 hours in and had to take a break because the knees, back, hand and neck are suffering the enjoyment and we need to do our mantainance practices or we ll die playing it. But just wanted to write something because we ve never been so hooked on a coop survival this way with my wife and she loves it as much as I do. And we didn t even found an island that progresses the story yet. We are scavenging like madpeople and the moment we see an island we go and adventure it.Anyway, if you have a significant one or a friend with whom you enjoy playing adventure games this might be for you. I recomend you go for the easy level if you are not used to this kind of games and even if you do but want to have a good time exploring.Raft is so far a 10 out of 10 and we love every minute of it. Will update on the next 10 hours. Time to move before we develp rigor mortis in life :P",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 OcakI'll give it a 2.5/5Building and tooling around in your trash boat is fun for a bit, but the story is thin, there's not much else to do, and combat is terrible - nothing beyond 'click monster until it dies' - made worse by a weapon durability mechanic, meaning you have to fill your inventory with weapons any time you're expecting a fight.The final boss pairs this with a loooong walk back to the fight zone, so when he eats you because you couldn't land 80 hits on him before he pukes on you, you kind of want to just stop playing.I also didn't like how the few friendly NPCs you meet just vanish into thin air to become a playable character rather than interacting in any meaningful way.And for some reason dirt of all things becomes the game's rarest resource late game, and seems to stop spawning after story mode is started, making crafting important things like armor annoyingly difficult.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 OcakThe game doesn't tell you much, what it does tell you it contradicts itself. My first experience with this was an island I found, got off straight away and went to explore, by then the raft had floated off, thought ""oh well"" looked at the guide book and it tells you to make another raft... except you literally can't do that, you get a hammer, try to build, but no blueprint or ghost appears, you can't click, literally are unable to make another raft, so the game is just ruined from then on, what's the point?More things I noticed after restarting and continuing:-No controller support-Questionable UI decisions-Lack of tutorial or any hints-Lack of QoL features like inventory sorting and defragging-Can't lock items to your hotbar-Unable to simply ""re-locate"" built items-Limited feedback on damaging enemies-Research system UI could do with improving to tell you what it's for and what you need to do-The sail is always in your face-You are seemingly unable to kill animals for food-You can't mine rocks that are on land, but you can if they're underwater?!?",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 OcakThere is a lot of good, but there is a LOT of bad.  It's a chill game on creative and easy mode.  The puzzles and story are fairly interesting and it is a peaceful experience.  But that's about it.Raft is not very intuitive.  I had to go online to look up how to do most things in the game and found that I could not do most of the things I wanted to do, which are present in most other survival games (ex:  repair inventory items, move build pieces (you have to destroy them with penalty to materials).  While I enjoy creative mode and easy mode, normal mode is not enjoyable in the least.  The constant presence of a great white was entirely too annoying.  There are a lot of dangers in the ocean, but when I kill a great white and another shows up one minute later, that gets to be less of a challenge and more of a pain.  Random sharks would make more sense.And the inability to chop down a single tree or log makes NO sense at all.  The only source of wood are palm trees and drift wood.  All other sources are unavailable.  I don't get that.  Especially when you need so much of it.I was going to check out Stranded Deep, but it looks like it got worse reviews.  I think the Forest 2 is coming out this year.  I supposed I'll wait for that.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 27 Aralık 2022I know a lot of people love this game but I just don't see why. I love survival/adventure games but this one just frustrates me. The graphics are fine. It runs well. The concept is good. Just the choices made for the controls aren't intuitive and nothing seems logical or makes sense in how it's implemented so when I try to do something, like drop anchor then pull it back up, I can't. I don't know why. I drop the anchor. Then how do I pull  it back up? There's a rope. I can't pull it back up. I dive into the water getting bit by the shark, find the anchor, can't grab it. All I can do is release it. There it goes. One time use anchor. That is just one of the many frustrations about this game I have.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Aralık 2022Game settings / in game inventory difficult to use, immediately buggy, personally unplayable.Most of my time in the game was trying to adjust the graphics in the settings to make it playable on my system. I think Raft would work best only if you can handle high graphics/strain on your computer because the settings are a nightmare.Besides the graphics, the controls and gameplay were wonky. It was hard moving my character around because it was really zoomed in on your visibility and the overall movement of the character and main casting/harvesting function was janky.Without any tutorial/minimal guidance at the beginning figuring out the mechanics is tricky, and you can't really take your time once the game starts.The game had an overall buggy/finnicky feel to it, with two definite bugs/glitches I encountered while playing.I would often not be able to pick my hook up after throwing it, and only after a bunch of button pushing and throwing the item on the ground could I use it again.I also wasn't able to use my hook to harvest stone as it would just flop on the ground and glitch out. I followed some tips online and restarted my game a couple times but was never able to harvest the item.Before completely giving up on the game, I tried the creative mode and I wasn't impressed with the function of the inventory or what the game mode had to offer.Looks fun on YouTube, but not the game for me, unplayable in my case.

"Yayınlanma: 22 Aralık 2022Raft is a game that is very similar to Minecraft.The entire gameplay is heavily dependent on a highly repetitive selections of chores, just to prepare you enough for the next exploration.In Minecraft, it mainly involves mining and farming. The former requires the same 2 input repeated for a few hours straight. The latter requires simply waiting while doing nothing.In Raft, it becomes stockpiling and sailing. The former is an endless cycle of collecting the same few resources above water, on land or underwater, the latter requires waiting.If you personally enjoy these kind of repetitive activities, you will find them calming, almost like some sort of digital meditation where you let go of your mind and let muscle memory does its job.However if you don't, then you'll find these as an artificial wall blocking the ""actual content"" of this game, which is the exploration and the story.Also the devs doesn't seem to be very interested in getting feedbacks, at least not on Steam. But at least the game is currentlycompleteand doesn't have some serious bugs.Lastly I would like to talk about the extremely horrible achievements in this game.When you finished the story which is about 10-20 hours, where 20% spent sailing (waiting for your boat to move to next Point of Interest), 50% spent gathering resource, 30% spent exploring/getting lost, you will only have about 50% of achievements. So it is basically a checklist for players who want some end game activities.Let's take the ""kill 50 of x enemies"" achievements for example.There's a monster called screecher, which spawns once on 1 of the 3 types of big islands.Each big islands is roughly 1500 meter apart. So you need to sail at least 50*1500m just for this achievement, if you are lucky that it spawns on all the islands you visited.The highest speed your raft can sail is roughly 2m/s, so it's a whopping 10 hours of doing absolute nothing.The there's another monster called anglerfish, which only spawns 6 at once on 1 story mode island. For story mode islands, you need to sail away 2000m for it to despawn (and thus respawn with enemies).So you need to sail about 8*2000m, plus 8*1500m (when story mode island respawn they are usually 1.5~2km from you), so that's another 4 hours gone while doing nothing.There's also this feature called treasure hunting. With 1 treasure spawned per small island and 2-3 treasure per big island.For 1st achievement, you need to acquire 4 of each ""x-items"" that has a 7.5% drop rate per treasure. So based on possibilities you need to dig up an average of 110 treasures for this achievement.For 2nd achievement, you need to acquire 8 of each ""y-items"" that has a 4.5% drop rate per RARE treasure (50%). So based on possibilities you need to dig up an average of... well you get the idea.And then there's this absolute nightmare achievements that requires you to survive 365 in-game days, which is 122 real life hours, or 82 hours if you sleep everyday to skip roughly 40 hours.And for reference, by the moment I've beaten the story mode, only ~100 in-game days had passed. So I basically had to afk in-game for the rest of 50+ hours... (after I've finished all other aforementioned abominations of achievements)Quite a horrible design choice I would say.So, final verdict. Do I recommend this game? Absolutely yes! Especially if it is on sale. Much more fun with a friend (multiplayer significantly lowers the difficulty by allowing zero-inventory-penalty respawn).Why negative review then? Because this game has got enough +revs and people/devs won't bother reading them. But I sincerely think the game can do better, and the devs should consider improving various imperfect designs.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 8 Aralık 2022It worked fine and was fun for the first few times I opened the game. But then, it started lagging so much for no reason. I did everything I could to fix it and nothing worked. It got to the point where walking around the raft (which is not that big by the way) would take hours. I had enough.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Aralık 2022I don't hate the game by any means, I just find it way too annoying to play earnestly. I know my opinion may not see like enough for anyone because I only played 30 hours but I gave the game my best attempt. I'm a casual player, I just wanted something that would offer a challenge but be kinda relaxing to play. But I was sorely disappointed with this one. Challenging isn't the word I'd use for this game though. And I'm sure others would swear at the awesomeness of this game.I played the game, I spent more time confused or angry, the fact that I couldn't enjoy the game vanilla infuriated me. 5 hours in I wanted mods to deal with certain mechanics of the game or features.For example, I can't get over how I would NEED to play the game on easy if I wanted to not rely on strangers to revive me if I died/fainted.I mean, there are ways to create punishments for dying, but forcing me to reach out to people on the internet to revive me just to keep the items I had gathered? That alone makes the game lose points for me. I wanted to play on normal, not easy and the punishment shouldn't be stay out of the game until you get a stranger to help you, or lose 2/3 of your inventory. Sorry, I've said it like twice now. I just can't get over this. I don't understand why that's a feature of the game at all! If I wanted to play with others I would gush about how much fun it is to play and ask them to join me. Instead I have to ask others to join my game to just so I can continue with my build with the items that took me over 10 minutes to gather.Also, it was hard for me to really enjoy the game because of the threats in the game. Sharks do not just keep attacking and EATING boats. If it looks like an animal or smells of blood then maybe but normal shark behavior is not depicted in this game and for me it was immersion breaking. Sharks do not eat wood or plastic intentionally. Why is the shark constantly doing so but then stops because metal? Like seriously? IDK, it destroyed my immersion every time. If I hurt myself or was in the water too long I would be okay with this shark being a threat but he's a threat for absolutely no reason whatsoever almost constantly.Because there is no leveling system there is no way for me to gauge my progress in the game. As you see I spent 30 hours in the game, that was mostly on one build. The first game, I died on the first night because I couldn't figure out how to get food for myself. That build was at most an hour and a half of gameplay.My second attempt, the one I spent a whole 20+ hours on,  I built various things but that was it. I struggled to find more recipes, or ways to get them. I died attempting to reach traders, I died gathering, I died from an immersion breaking shark getting to me after I discovered too late that a pufferfish will release a gas cloud.And as I had no way to heal myself (because I hadn't unlocked that recipe AND there absolutely no way to loot it) I died the second I got too close to my boat because the shark got his three bites in.IDK, I don't think this game really lived up to my expectations and I am kinda disappointed about that.So, I decided that deleting the game was a better option. I believe in a general sense I wasted my money. I found the game disappointing, I didn't find myself ever gushing about the game with others, I never found myself laughing about how I died/fainted. I found myself more angry and annoyed and confused.Anyway, all that to day, I deleted the game. It would be a solid 2/5 stars for me. And I can't recommend a game that made me feel bitter for putting money on it.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 4 Aralık 2022Patch with stupid flying bombarding birds ruined whole game and whole experience.

"Yayınlanma: 30 Kasım 2022Do NOT play on the normal mode or higher.  The death penalty is 2/3 of your items which is fine when you can get back to your ship and unload on a regular basis.  It definitely makes you try to avoid dying.However, there is a least one part of the game where you explore a city and have little or no chance to unload your stuff.  A death here is crippling.

Yayınlanma: 28 Kasım 2022Good Until you die. 2/3rds of inventory is deleted upon death. Remaining 2 thirds of items aren't dropped at death location. The loss of often vital items often softlocks the progression requiring the world to be deleted. Files also cannot be easily backed up and restored due character data being unrelated from world data. Dropped Items also despawn also allowing potential for the game to be softlocked.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 27 Kasım 2022It's a good game but it's just not for me. The food and water gauge drop rapidly so you're just constantly fighting to find resources and getting attacked by sharks and it's just ""sit on the raft and go from place to place"" and then get tired of doing the same thing forever.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 26 Kasım 2022Let me start by saying I have put a good amount of time into this game. It is fun to play. A little grindy at times, but otherwise it is a fun game to just play. However, the story leaves something to be desired. I don't have a problem with learning the story through notes that you find (which is how this is), but there is little to nothing connecting the story locations to each other. The only connection is finding the coordinates to the next location. Then you get to Temperance and it is filled with notes about a guy that steals from everyone he meets and no one is able to put 2 and 2 together that he is the one doing it. Lastly, you get to Utopia and... and... well let's just say it feels like it was rushed. Like there was no thorough thought put into it at all. The hole thing is a puzzle (if you want to call it that) that consists of ""build up to this floor, boss gets to throw bombs at you that take up to 30 seconds to go away, then build up to this floor, rinse and repeat."" The so called final boss fight isn't fun and challenging its just irritating and unbalanced. You will die often.In summary, would I recommend this game as something fun to play...Yes.Would I recommend this to anyone who wanted more than something to just play, i.e. story, balance, unique experience, etc.  ABSOLUTELY NOT.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 25 Kasım 2022Ürünün iadesi gerçekleştirildiGame ultimately lacks that thrill that co-op provides you with.

"Yayınlanma: 25 Kasım 2022Saw all the positive reviews so gave it a crack since Survival/builder games are my jam. Throw your first hook into the water. If the physics bother you this game isn't for you. The shark mechanics are what really took me out. No matter where me and my friend were, the shark knows where you are at all times. Even on an Island we noticed the shark isn't even circling the island, its just bouncing back and forth where we were. Really not a fan of lazy physics and predictable enemies, especially when its apparent within the first 5 minutes of the game. Unless there's a compelling storyline i'm unaware of, I have no Idea how people put so many hours into this for anything other than creative mode.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Kasım 2022I just can't love this game.I have tried and tried to enjoy this game that so many seem to enjoy but it feels so empty.Pros,The concept as a whole is really unique and that is noteworthy alone.Graphically it holds up even though it is ticking on a little now.Resource gathering although limited is easy.Cons,The crafting system is so limited and seems almost lazy.With a world so big and so well thought out there is actually very little to do.The dev's instead of making meaningful content just seemed to have made everything resource heavy to create, that is not content, that is padding and it is utterly pointless.The controls in the interface are revolting, compared to other games in the same genre they feel clunky and poorly made, which only adds to the frustration.The achievements are not achievements for learning or being good at the game, they are just mostly 'do this 500 times' it is just again, lazy.The lack of items to craft is a tragic oversight considering the age and potential of the game, they could have gone all the way through to motorised which would have been at least something noteworthy for endgame.Not even able to customise your character apart from the colour of their clothes, like many I enjoy a custom character as it means I can express myself in video game form.The lack of unique resource types is almost laughable, again, if it were not so sad because of the wasted potential of this game.There is not enough content here to warrant the asking price.I hate thumbing games down, I really do, because I am no developer, but I try my best to make sure I leave good reviews when the game itself is worthy of one. For £15 you are not getting a game that has seen enough love or attention, this game should be no more than £7 and even then at best you are getting 7-15 hours of content, at a push mind.I think this game falls into that old 'fun for Youtuber's' category which is a frustrating growing trend, a Youtuber will put 30 hours of content into a 20 minute video so you think the game is amazing.Majority of this game is stood on your boat waiting for an island to appear so you can cut down three trees to make 2 walls.GamingShouldn'tBeAJobThis game feels like a job, avoid unless on sale, what a shame and so much wasted potential.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 Ekim 2022I absolutely enjoyed the sandbox-survival-building core game-play of Raft! Sadly, this falls away  into unreasonably big sections of less than mediocre linear story adventure game. These gate progression and frustrated me so much I couldn't bear to finish. Even consulting video walkthroughs.There's also a lack of polish - I managed to stumble into a glaring soft-lock issue, 1 hour into my first world: unable to move my raft from where it had washed up against a nook of an island, I tired disassembling it to rebuild on the other side. Turns out it had let me brake my world, without warning; THE raft is the centre of reality and you can't start anew. But 'loosing' one's raft doesn't end the game, either. Merely lets you death cycle, thrown back into open water for the shark to eat for all eternity.I'm glad I gave it another chance, after rage quitting from that initial impression. There's some good game play, with building up and tech'ing up your floating home. I just wish  the game had stayed more focused on that. The small islands are fine. But suddenly there's really huge ones, which are tediously slow to run about and explore, while running out of food/water (and it getting too dark to see) if not already having a good idea where to go.Then the middle story mission islands are incongruously linear, requiring an extremely specific series of waypoints where it's easy to miss something, even following directions. It's a completely different type of game, which I didn't enjoy. And is badly hobbled further by the survival mechanics remaining in place, putting too much time pressure on everything. And consumption of durability, especially on more 'expensive' items was too punishing to justify bothering to use them.Being incapacitated was too punishing in normal difficulty single player, too. It felt pretty bad having to consent to die and loose 2/3rds of my items, because I had no friend to revive me for free. That's pretty much all inventory. Which generally meant having to leave that island and loosing an hour or two's progress to re-farm and re-craft the higher tier items.I would give this a ""maybe"" verdict, but Steam doesn't allow that! So my experience has tipped it slightly over into negative. Which is a shame, because it's an interesting game, and quite unique in my experience.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 21 Ekim 2022There is no middle-of-the-road recommendation option.It's fun, it's a cool idea, and I had a blast for a while with friendsBUTit's a bit too grindy. Expanding your raft in the beginning when the game is fresh, it's easy peasy, just hook some wood/plastic, hop on an island for even more wood and free food, all is good. You're fighting the elements, you're trying to survive. But as you continue to build on your raft to make room for the ever expanding list of processing stations to make the next tiers of tools and materials and whatever else, all while you are trying to follow the story, you are still hooking and island hopping and gathering supplies. Constantly.Cooking food takes wood, making water takes wood, smelting ore takes wood. Just make collection nets to collect things passively? Need wood, rope, and nails. How do you get nails? Collect a (limited) amount of scrap at the next island while a shark nibbles on you for half your health. If your hook breaks at any point, you need wood and plastic for another one at the very least. But you should also build raft foundation (wood and plastic) around your collection nets, because you don't want them easily eaten by sharks, if you even have enough materials for it because your grills/water purifiers/ore smelters are also eating up your wood supply.It's like you are ALWAYS low on something. Tools are constantly breaking, the raft is constantly getting eaten, you are constantly hungry/thirsty, and the materials to keep those things in check are never in stock like you want them.Yes, there's a great water purifier that doesn't need wood later on, yippee. Yes, you can grow trees on your raft, but even that becomes a chore because you are just breaking your axe against it for a negligible amount of wood compared to the wood requirements of you and your tools, the raft, all the stations and your friends (if applicable). And wood is the easiest thing to get, compared to plastic and scrap which you'll also want handy.You would think that sometime around mid-game/late-game, there would be better ways to address this stuff. Food and water isn't a problem for me, it's just a pain to prepare it. It's a pain to still be fighting sharks off the raft, still be breaking tools, and still need to hop on every island for supplies. What used to be great survival fun, is not, because I've already done that stuff hundreds of times. By the time we got to thegigantic island full of bearsand werebeing murdered by bearsin addition to still having to manage food/water and our tools and weapons breaking while navigating this place, we were pretty much exhausted and done with the game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 17 Ekim 2022This is the first time I'm leaving a review!Raft is a survival, crafting, item managing game.It's one of the first steam games I bought and the first I've actually finished.I've replayed it each time a new chapter came out, and it was a lot of fun playing it with my partner, discovering the new additions and story.Now that we've finished the story...here is where the thumbs down comes from.(If they bring out DLC's or a story continuation I might change the thumbs direction).SPOILERS AHEAD!When the 3rd chapter came out, chapters one and two played out mostly the same. I enjoyed how the POI islands slowly built up in size and difficulty and the cool tech we would discover.But the 3rd chapter kind of lost it's way. It felt like someone who was telling a story and forgot what the point was, and became fixated on the wrong detail. The BIG BAD wasn't the climate ruining technology or the corporations that caused it, it was the Military General from the cruise ship, Olaf. The fix wasn't finding an island and starting a community, and using the rafts to gather people and adapt to the ocean life whilst reversing the catastrophe, it was putting Olaf in jail.After all the crafting and ""Frontier"" type exploration, the ending was lack lustre to say the least. It was a ""K THNX BYE"" to defeating the BB and his somehow genetically modified Hyena, and left in a plaza that had no easy access in and out of. It was also missing some of the characters whose stories you would follow on your journey and had a bunch of randoms.It felt...unfinished, like the 2nd book of a series, and the real big bad was going to properly surface in the 3rd and final book.You don't find out what happened to the parents, or why you always were a step behind the people in the stories. Or why you start on just 4 pallets of wood.Also, later game blueprints came out way too late in the progression. We've finished the game and only then get the blueprints for titanium tools and weapons. Could have used them in the final battle!Also the trader was a cool concept, but maybe better to use the trash cubes to buy the fish bait and the coins to get everything else...It is a fun game, but the replayability is zero unless you do it for the crafting and to enjoy the sea life.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 11 Ekim 2022No tutorial. no assistance. no guide.  the shark takes way too many hits even on easy. and i think it respawns quick even when killed, so those do not make sense together on easy mode.I want to play with bruce but you havent set it right. or need to provide more options to start the game to suit the user.so little time of playing and my raft dissapeared into an island then randomly came out the other side 20 minutes later...the shark also swims in and out of the land, and eats your 3 platform raft while it is stuck immoveable by a noob with no resources to craft something to make it move.. err fail.i found rocks on land.. but they are glitched there and are meant to be underwater so you cannot farm them, just throw your hook at it.is playing minecraft a prerequisite or something? is making a tutorial that hard? it doesnt hinder longtime users adding a tuitorial button in the main menu... or a button flashing on the side of the screen for the first 2 minutes of gameplay...I did not find an enjoyable experience.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ekim 2022I like the premise and the basic idea, but overall the game is lacking. Every island except the story islands have nothing unique to offer and everything feels so grindy/empty/cookie cutter with unity resources visually apparent where they were glued together (and story islands have rare unique resources to grind that may get old quickly). The story is just a noise in the background that gives you a crazy contrived story of a military man post-apocalypse that abuses a mutating virus for a contrived boss-fight in a game where combat is not the best. Story path solutions are very random and remind me of first generation point and click adventures that required the magic macguffin to solve (no worries on solving it though, the world is so empty it's impossible not to find the macguffins). You can tell there was effort as some QoL changes were made to the crafting system, but it's still lacking on that end too (the quick construct that was added doesn't work from chests and resources are grind central). Everything feels like scrapped assets that were thrown together haphazardly to ship a product out the door. Hopefully the developer can manage the next project better and give a more populated experience.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 28 Eylül 2022The discovery phase of the game where you wander on your raft, build stuff and find islands is somewhat fun and original albeit short. Once you progress through the tech tree, you can build antennas and a radar which will allow you to find bigger islands: this is how you progress through the story. Once I reached that point the tedium quickly ramped up.Those islands require you to search barren environements, littered with trash that fill up your inventory and a few enemies scattered here and there, to pick up dairies, solve a few puzzles and finally get the location of the next island. However, there is only a handful of interesting puzzles and combat involves sticking your spear/machete in rats/boars/robots/whatever with no enjoyable feedback whatsoever. All that is left is listening to way too many survivor diaries telling you the story of the game.I only got up to the domed city with a friend before giving up, that's roughly ~60% of the game done if I had to guess. It's possible it gets better after but I don't feel it's worth it forcing myself to push through it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Eylül 2022After playing this game for 90 hours, I can say that it falls very short of what it could've been.  I really wanted to like this game, and I've sunk so many hours into it because I enjoy some of the building mechanics, and I've also needed to prepare to continue the campaign with my friends in our shared save.  The art style is pretty albeit after a while I realized that different environments are just retextures of each other, and the farther we'd progress in the game the more glitches and infuriating intentional mechanics become apparent.  Infuriating mechanics include not being able to harvest some trees on islands when there's no reason to make it that way in the first place, the terrorbirds being too OP, or doing well with one of the bosses only for the shark to annihilate all of us since we weren't expecting him to come around.  Glitches include getting stuck in the air at one point of the story without being able to unstuck myself, or a fishing rod turning into a sharkbait.  I've enjoyed playing the story with my friends and building a tiny raft into a massive pirate ship, but I really wish more could've been done to refine the game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 23 Eylül 2022it got me hooked from the start, really nice game...............that's what I wrote when I started it, I do not feel like that anymore...The game starts nice and fun, the idea of building your raft is really nice, but then you get hit with 3 under average puzzles and before you notice it, the game has ended, there is nothing, not a satisfying ending, just a few pieces of equipment that are useless since you already finished the game.Starting the game the different islands are fun to explore, but once you have seen them they become repetitive and predictable, with not enough different options. You will know exactly where every resource, enemy and landmark is, every enemy has just one pattern that is extremely easy to read, and you'll end up visiting the same island every time because you'll just end up grinding the fisherman shop.The concept is so big and yet it feels small and repetitive, with no replay value at all, unless you just enjoy building crazy rafts, which also gets old pretty quick. A little more investment in story and replay value (more island types with variations on each, a few more enemy types, coherent story twists that keep you on your toes...).And WHY OH GOD WHY would you give me the best items, the one's you would like to use to fight the final boss, basically when you do not need them for ANYTHING anymore? If you had a optional boss to fight after the final one, or something of the sorts, it would have made sense, but the game feels like it was supposed to be longer and just drops dead after that fight, leaving you with new stuff you are not even going to craft.All in all a nice game to play once and then never visit again, the ending ruined my fun so much a haven't touched the game since.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Eylül 2022All this game needed was some user testing performed by casual gamers. Nothing about this game is intuitive.

After fighting tooth and nail with this game to figure out how to make water and not die of dehydration, my boat got stuck on some rocks, and I couldn't get it out with the paddle. It was the final nail in the coffin. I don't recommend.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 11 Eylül 2022*** Could have been a Classic ***I can see why a lot of people enjoy this game. It's a great idea. It's just that the balance feels very off to me. I would be playing more if it wasn't such a grind. Don't get me wrong, though. I don't usually mind grindy games. In fact, they are my favorite types of games. I'm getting frustratingly bored doing the same stuff over and over again.Here's an example. I build the first wooden spear. It's easy to build, but it's use is rather short lived. It takes 2 of them to stab the shark to death. Eventually, I get the next spear. It requires a bit of iron, and is about twice as deadly as the first spear. The thing is, it only lasts around 2 to 3 times as long. This mechanic is present among most of the equipment. This seems ok at first, but starts to irritate you after a while. It's not as easy to get iron, which really requires you to burn through a few spears to kill the shark just to get the iron you need again. In other words, it take you a lot longer than what you would think to try to get ahead of the curve.This was even worse for me with the flippers. When I first got flippers, I was thought I was now playing in style. Then I realized the flippers had durability. They also take quite a bit of materials to make. The flippers did not last very long at all. I felt like I wasn't properly rewarded for my time. I'm not even sure why they wore out so fast. Do they melt in the water or something odd? I really don't know.Look. I get it. There's supposed to be some sort of challenge to a survival game. I play many of them. But there is a difference between challenge and just being tedious. This game is more tedious than challenging.My next venture was growing my own food. It seemed like at least his would be worth my time. I planted some melons and they grew at a decent pace. Then the seagulls came. They eat your stuff faster than you can blink. So I did the logical thing, and built a scarecrow. Victory was mine. So I thought, anyways. The Scarecrow kept the seagulls away as planned, but the annoying birds destroyed my scarecrow way faster than expected. I was totally disappointed.The shark eats your raft. The birds eats your plants. Your stuff breaks way too quickly. Your food and water bars drop way to fast. This makes the game more frustrating than fun. You seriously have to babysit everything.To simplify everything I just said, the game just doesn't respect your time. Progression needs to feel like progression. It shouldn't feel like tedium replaced by more tedium. Watching paint dry isn't a challenge. It's just watching paint dry.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Eylül 2022This game has potential, but is pretty broken in my opinion.  After 9 hours of playing 2 saves where the game ends up ruining my experience both times, I'm finished playing.  I will admit I was having fun, but spending 4 or 5 hours on a save for the game to death loop you out of nowhere is pretty aggravating.First spawn I leave my raft at the shoreline of an island with the current pushing it into shore without an anchor (rookie mistake I know).  However the raft didn't run away from me out to sea.  Rather it pushed further and further into shore until it sunk into the sand underneath the island and left me alone on the island without any of my stuff.  Frustrating, but I learn I need an anchor and restart a new spawn.Next spawn after several more hours I pull up to an Island with my sail, anchor, and paddle ready to go and get death looped immediately after I drop anchor.  Multiple birds take turns dropping rocks on my head so I only have maybe 10 seconds after I spawn to try to move my raft.  How is the player supposed to know that simply parking their raft containing hours and hours of resources in one place is going to death loop them?This really seems unbalanced and I just cannot recommend anybody spend time building up in this game.  It will break your save out of nowhere.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Eylül 2022Starts off fun, plenty of difficulty settings to tailor the experience for you.I wish I could have the hunger/thirst needs of the highest difficulty but without the perma death (if playing solo since no one can come and ress you).Too many ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" deaths. Like suddenly having a rock dropped on you without any warnings of a big bird being on the island.You unlock more blueprints from progressing the story, but once you do (fairly short, maybe a 6-12'ish hour experience if you purely aim for it) what reason is there left to continue playing?Like once your boat is shark proof and you realize how few variations of islands there are I felt no motivation to continue playing after completing the story.This isn't Sea of Thieves where going on adventures with friends has the same vibe.Cooking is fun and some of the best parts was finding new recipes to go beyond grilling fish and veggies and making real dishes.It's fun to build the raft, but it takes too much resources to build the basic floors/walls/support beams. You don't get very far on it and with how late into the story you get the cool blueprints you don't get to fully develop your ship by the time you're done.The shark boss was terrible btw. And the final boss was a very underwhelming damage sponge.I wish there was more out there in the ocean. Like how it's marketed on the store page that you can meet people. You can't. Not until you finish the story and get one island with people on it. It's just you and every single animal suffering from rabies as they aggro you from across the moon.Pro tip if you want to loot the coral reefs around islands: Park your raft on the other side a bit away. The sharks circles your raft, but only attacks it if you're on it. That way you can dip into the water without the need of of bait (which is crap) to keep the sharks away. And seeing as the most important materials are there except for wood, it's well worth to do it in peace.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Ağustos 2022My feelings about this game are really mixed. They're generally positive but I'm marking this review as negative because of my experiences with solo play. I also want to add that my hours are inaccurate as I have at least a couple dozen more hours from solo offline play.Raft is generally a very chill game to play. I really like the raft building mechanics and the horizontal beams and decorative boards added in 1.0 can really lend itself to some cool raft designs. Playing with friends can be pretty hit or miss - my girlfriend and I get very groggy whenever we play for some reason. No idea why.Now, the reason this is negative. My main intention with this game was to play the game solo on offline mode. The game is notable for being particularly buggy with offline mode - while the game is still relatively playable, it is up until you reachTangaroa. You can't interact with any of the puzzles or the elevator at the end. This is because they cannot function when Steam is in Offline mode for some reason. I owned and played this game while it was in beta and don't recall having any issues with the area while in Offline mode before. While I got around to finishing it when I am able to use Wi-Fi, I really don't like the choice the developers made to ship the game in such a state where Internet is required for solo play. I'd give the developers the benefit of the doubt and say that there's probably some really bad bug that couldn't be easily fixed before shipping out 1.0.Still, I wanted to play the game solo in offline mode, and it sucks that you can only do it up to a certain point. I'll change my review when the bug is fixed because otherwise, it's a very fun and enjoyable game.TL;DR if you intend upon playing the game solo in offline mode, or playing the game using the Steam Deck outside your house, do not buy this game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 20 Ağustos 2022Raft is so close to being great- But it falls far short of improving anything about the genre it fits itself in, and introduces mechanics actively worse than most of its competitors.Simple tweaks to durability, construction costs, or recipes would go a long way towards making the game simply put, radically better. Breaking a ship part does NOT refund its cost- meaning every mistake in placement of a board will add up extremely fast. Accidentally breaking a part that holds up other parts also breaks those without any chance of a recoup of loss either, meaning simple construction projects like knocking out a lower wall will obliterate a massive chunk of your entire raft, including EXTREMELY expensive equipment you had to scrounge for hours to build. This lack of recouped losses, for some reason, also includes RETEXTURING ship parts- if you want to swap out your raft's ramshackle aesthetic for the very nice looking thick boards or the pretty overgrown vines, you're going to have to boot the ENTIRE cost of building your raft from scratch to do so.The game also has a massive focus on combat without putting a lick of effort into actually trying to make that combat fun. None of the weapons are fun to use, nor seem to hit particularly accurately (specifically the melee weapons), and have basically zero reach. If an enemy isnt literally an inch from your camera, you're probably not going to hit it. Arrows seem to curve downwards inexorably from gravity at almost a rate of a foot per meter, making them operate effectively more in the range that the melee weapons ought to have been, and making them essentially the only viable weapon throughout the entire game's runtime. Almost every enemy is capable of easily murdering you with little effort, but most encountes boil down to simply noticing them before they notice you and take a quarter of your health bar away and then abusing the fact that they dont move while doing an attack animation (which can help you out against every single eenemy up to and including the last boss). Simply put, the combat just isn't fun, in any meaningful metric, and it actively brings down the overall enjoyment of the game.Most upgrades to you, your raft, or your supplies are temporary at best and will always, always inevitably need to be replenished. You cant replace the battery in your metal detector, or put more oxygen in your oxygen tank after its spent- these things just randomly and automatically combust the second they reach zero percent spent, and have zero ways to repair.  And this applies to every single aspect of the game, which a vast multitude of objects that should be permanent upgrades to either you or your characters simply being not even worth bothering with because they'll all break within the next 10 minutes of playing, basically regardless of whatever it is you do, from flippers to weapons to ziplines, there's a large number of mechanics that seem fun on paper but cost a significant and horrific drain on your resources to actually attempt to have fun with past the initial one you build that eventually, like everything else, breaks.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 20 Ağustos 2022Too many beginner's traps at the start of the game. The game supposedly has had an extensive Early Access, so those beginner's traps must be intentional.The game doesn't let you build a new raft if existing one drifts off, which is near-guaranteed when you first start the game. So most new players will be stranded and soft-locked within the first few minutes.You can be short of specific resources right at the start due to RNG, so you can't make even the bare essentials before you die from thirst or starvation.Apparently your character has the metabolism of The Flash in normal difficulty, because she has to consume food every minute.Lots of mechanical clunkiness, like useless raw materials getting into use bar, or objects not gatherable unless they are submerged, or not being able to pluck leaves from trees, etc.Lots of intentional frustrations piling up like fast-respawning Sharks, Seagulls, and homing birds that drop rocks.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 19 Ağustos 2022It is Sabnautica without a story and magnificent underwater life, so, without killer features. One main good point - is building the raft itself. But even this process is not as fun as it can be. Expanding your raft pretty long process that minimizes the fun of the development. Limited islands are boring and made only for the grind. Story useless spiced up with the boring and senseless game flow like ""find the hummer to break the lock"", why do I need exactly that hummer? What is wrong with any random rock that is big enough? The only purpose of the story is not to gain fun but only to obtain new blueprints for a raft. And after the raft had been built came nothing. No goal, no additional exploration. The last good point - is that this game is completed but it may be more interesting if it has more activities except for building rafts and grinding.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 18 Ağustos 2022***This is going to be a very mixed review***Raft okay... where to start with this? While the gameplay itself was enjoyable, I wish there was a bit more added to the story. After playing this game for ~39hrs I would've liked more context to the flood, what happened that caused everyone to build rafts and more of the struggles that humanity endured during this time, maybe even some cut scenes to add more to the story.Some things I would like to see changed is firstly the default sprint/faster swim. Honestly it's not all that fast and when trying to get back quickly to another person who is being attacked it gets frustrating.Secondly my boyfriend and I encountered some problems when playing on a server with just us that I hosted. There are moments of desync or lag, but there are moments that either the game or server has bugged out completely and we have each missed out on things. One time I got into an elevator, he pressed the button to go up and for me the elevator disappeared and I got stuck in the elevator shaft. Unsure if a server restart would've fixed it or not because he continued on without me and completed the objective and I just used the unstuck option to get back to the raft. The other time was right at the end of the story, when he opened the doors for some reason I got the cut scene and set up to the grounds where all other rafters were and he did not, restarting the server did not help in this instance and because of that he missed out on the ending and was pissed off (which I mean is understandable, we both put 30+hrs into the game and he missed the ending).Thirdly I think the ending of the game could've used a little more to it, it just felt very.... lacking and not pleasing.While I would recommend this game to other friends, there are for sure things that need fixing first before I do so. This game has quite the opportunity to expand and improve and I truly hope it does, but because of the things stated above this is why I'm giving a thumbs down.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 15 Ağustos 2022This is an incredibly difficult review for me to write...it breaks my heart. I've been playing Raft since July of 2020, and it seems like the game has been diminishing little by little with each subsequent update. Now that the game is complete, and I have finished it, I can finally submit a review. I cannot discuss my issues with this game without mentioning the story, and while the story is not a mystery, nor does it rely on intrigue, I shall be blocking-out portions of this review that contain mild-spoilers.Chapter Onewas an absolutely wonderful game. Equal parts harrowing, haunting, and hopeful. It was saturated with a forlorn calm (punctuated by intense moments of crisis) brought on by the deep sense of isolation: just you, a tiny floating platform, the flotsam and junk of the ocean, and a lonely shark who wants to be mouth-friends (at least that's what's in my head-cannon). Who are you? Where do you come from? How did you get into your current predicament? All mysteries.A strange feeling of triumph spreads through you as you slowly gain control of your surroundings and start to stabilize your new maritime life. You would see hints of other human life occasionally: notes in a radio tower, graffiti on a wall, abandoned rafts floating derelict out in the wastes of the ocean (no sign of their previous occupant). These tiny reminders that others had existed in this strange world. How long had they been gone, and were they still alive?You come across Balboa Island - a temperate island infested with bees... and bears. Why does a temperate island with birch and pine trees exist near tropical islands with coconut palms and mango trees? Why are there so many bears? Why is there a radioactive pool near the ranger station? These were all strange, but they did not break the immersion of the game - it stillfeltright.Chapter One delivered a great experience - you could play it a casually or as seriously as you wanted. I eagerly looked forward to the following chapters.Chapter Twoadded to the game without losing much. An abandoned town of caravans, trailers, and camper vans - all teetering on rocky precipices. A high-tech biodome - complete with robot butlers patrolling the self-contained futuristic city. Both of these locations were packed with flavor... and both were abandoned. This was great world-building, with interesting environments and fanciful (yet grounded) settings and technology. Good stuff.But Chapter Two is also where the cracks start to appear - hinting atthe flooding of the Earthand establishing the ""villain"" of the story. At the time, you don't realize that they are setting up the main bad-guy, you just think it's neat backstory (because you don't really get a sense of how long ago the events happened - was it 20 years ago, or was it last Tuesday?)The Final Chapteris where the game tries to squeak-out a fart, but ends up filling its pants with diarrhea. You end up exploring sunkenskyscrapersand realize you are now in the movie""WaterWorld""... ifKevin Costnercame zipping-by on a jet-ski, it wouldn't feel out of place. You find tropical islands with coral reefs, pineapple and melons growing just 800 meters (that's half-a-mile) from an arctic research station with polar bears and glaciers. Any sense of immersion you've managed to build crumbles quickly.The story culminates at the final location, Utopia, where (and I have to type this slowly, so I don't have a stroke) the mustache-twirling nincompoop-of-a-villain has taken over with the help ofhis army of radioactive hyenas. I wish I was joking about that. This guy feels like he was rejected from an episode of the '60s ""Batman"" TV show (with Adam West and Burt Ward). He proceeds to lead you through the saddest funhouse ever designed for a game, full of platforming (in a game not designed for platforming). At one point there are a series of fans that are spinning for no reason. It's not like they are windmills that are generating power, or pumping water, or grinding food... nope, they have no in-world reason to exist - they are just obstacles for the sake of being obstacles to your movement. Theyaremade of fabric and wood though, so you should be able to simply destroy them with your ax, right? Of course not... in fact, if you get close to them, they will bounce you away - like a drunken hamster ricocheting around inside of a dryer (because physics be damned).Now I hear you saying: ""But Gent, you throbbing fop, why don't you just shoot the villain with arrows?"" To which I tell you, I did. I riddled that guy with arrows, they do nothing. The game is going to force you through a series of puzzles and platforming until it comes time for you to face-off against hislegion of special-needs hyenas. The final one willvomit acidic mutagenandthrowbouldersat you (ashyenasare known to do). It'sEXACTLYwhat a game about ocean-survival needs:hyenas, the most dangerous ocean predator on the planet.The worst part of all this is after you defeat the villain and he says something to the effect of: ""these survivors are weak, and dumb, and they need someone strong and smart to take charge."" To which I realize the villain is100%correct. These idiot survivors saw a lunatic leading abattalion of radioactive hyenas, and instead of killing him on the spot, they welcomed him into their community. Humanity will not survive much longer in this game, because the survivors are all brain-damaged.So, in closing, the game of Raft (much like this review) starts off coherent and grounded, only to devolve into utter clown-world madness.I will continue to play every once in a while, exclusively for the casual experience of floating around and crafting a nicer raft - and if that's your interest in this game (the MinecRAFT experience) then you will find some enjoyment in playing it. But as a reviewer, I will address the game that the developersactuallymade, the story theyactuallywrote, and not the experience you can craft for yourself. The sandbox aspect is fine, but the game itselfsucks.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 12 Ağustos 2022Such a great concept for a game so much so that I'm wanting to play it with all the nuances that come with it. I bought this game AFTER it was fully released, I understand it spent a lot of time in early access; which only leads to my confusion as to why they claimed it to be finished when it is still missing some basic essentials nearly every game comes with. By that I mostly mean the fact that there is no tutorial or game hints to show you basic controls on how to operate the game. Be prepared to learn this game on youtube first as not everything is immediately obvious.I've also found that building, even while in creative mode, is incredibly limiting. You basically have to guess on what you can or cannot do till the game accepts or rejects as there is no guidance on where you can or cannot place items and building structures. I feel like I'm building blind. Youtube is a little help, but there is very little guidance though some people have posted helpful tutorials and workarounds.I'm surprised there is no workshop support, this game seems perfect for it, but along my youtube journey on learning this game I've also seen some people using mods so there must be some kind of third party mod support.Over all it's really the weird limiting building system, or lack thereof, as to why I cannot recommend this game. If you don't care about building the rest of the game isn't nearly as awkward to learn.Edit: The more hours I put in the more I hate everything about building in this game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 10 Ağustos 2022This game is fun in it's own genre.  Some things make sense, others don't.  Some collision mechanics are downright broken.The most infuriating mechanic of the game is unrecoverable loss of inventory upon death.  Meaning that you can spend a day gathering resources and crafting items, and then one mistake will erase all that effort, not a an ideal scenario for a casual gamer.  I have had to walk away from the game occasionally for a period of time in anger after accidentally jumping into the water with low health and getting murdered by the shark, or getting caught by multiple bears, subsequently losing most of the valuable items in my inventory.The problem is that this issue has been brought to the developer's tone-deaf ears on multiple occasions, and suggestions were made on how to keep the game challenging without penalizing the player so severely, however, it does not seem like anything will ever change with this regard.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 10 Ağustos 2022Not a fan of the online DRM (also not a fan of developers trying to play it off as an ""unfixable bug""). Also the survival aspect feels bolted on. Survival hasn't been a significant challenge but you'll have to learn how to survive the tedium. The basic construction has been an incredibly boring unenjoyable grind so far. Every tool is consumable and the shark will disassemble the raft and undo your work while you're away gathering resources. I just fail to see what's so enjoyable about this kind of the gameplay loop.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 9 Ağustos 2022A chill, although kind of boring, survival game. Decent for a more calmer ""survival"" experience. Was all right with my buddy but playing solo was boring and horrible. My raft got stuck on a large island, which arrived way sooner in my solo play than in my multiplayer play (assuming it's random). But my raft got lodged onto the island. I explored it, got a bunch of stuff, but a large bird (I'm assuming it's a Roc) kept dropping rocks on me, even while I was trying to paddle to break free from the island. The Roc was relentless and I lost all of my inventory. By this point I had not researched how to make a bow and so only had a spear, so I couldn't even fight back. Was a very frustrating way to die, especially when everything had been going so smoothly up to that point. Roc's agro should stop once you leave the island. For how lackluster the game itself is, can't recommend anyone buying it if it has bs things like that in it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 9 Ağustos 2022I've enjoyed this game a lot, and my kids enjoy the peaceful mode as an alternative to minecraft. Up until recently I had been recommending it to friends - but not anymore. I encountered a recurring health drain issue after a puffer fish exploded next to me - health stops going down, seconds later it's draining again. Until I died - now the issue I had is that EVERY save is overwritten to just before I die, meaning that to progress I have to take the 2/3 loss of everything - EVERYTHING, inventory, gear, tools. The loss even seems to extend to my chests on my raft, which must be a bug?!. Now I'm prepared for death penalties and I'm prepared for a continuous save - I play 7 days most of the time! But when it's a hidden mechanic, that is also buggy, it smacks more of designers presuming to tell me how to play the game, rather than me choosing how to. And that is a warning sign to me. So right now, I wouldn't recommend the game.",N/A

I don't know exactly what the cause is, but the game turns out to be abandoned. the final chapter cost about 3 years of waiting, then what, just a pinch of joke, some small updates, no radical changes from the first versions, just some jellyfish, two dolphins (with which you cannot interact in any way) and an immense infinite ocean of nothing. no seabed to explore, no caves, no mysteries, secrets or easter eggs. the game, however valid technically, fascinating as a concept, but why not, sometimes even fun (even if tedious, not a moment goes by when you don't eat or drink, you can't literally enjoy a moment of peace with that immortal shark that gnaws the raft and the hunger of an elephant under thc, you could eat the whole ocean, useless) completely lacks depth, details, setting ... the islands are all completely the same, just 5-6 concepts repeated with the same spawn of objects and backdrops ... once you explore some of them it's just an endless loop, and often history takes you to places you've already visited recently. there is never, I say never a surprise, something colossal, everything is damn flat and full of barely useful crafting objects. cute how much you can '' embellish '' the raft, but beyond taking an incredible amount of materials, it does not bring any real benefit. the characters are glassy, ​​their eyes look at nothing, there is no interaction with any object, they never speak, it is as if they were ghosts. a cooperative game based on non-cooperating. no interaction, no boost to being friendly. not to mention the discomfort that is created if you fall off the raft and go adrift, first restart the world. the islands are blunt potatoes created in the editor in 5 seconds if not less, anyone would be able to do a more decent job even as a neophyte and without a budget. the NPCs, of animals and birds are tough and without the slightest intelligence, they have an out-of-the-ordinary aggression, they want to kill you at any cost, anywhere, crossing every wall and mountain, without the slightest logic. the worst scene is that of the stranded ship ... the ship conceptually makes no sense ... it has long, empty corridors with nothing. without rooms, without rooms, as if those who lived on them, between guests and workers, walked 200 meters in a corridor without windows or doors that makes a senseless zigzag just to give space to the rooms with the quests. everything has the sole purpose of, either slow you down to make you complete the quest slowly, or get lost with the same purpose. exploring does not reward, you think there could be something, no there isn't. the only glimmer of interest was the box above the ship's roof, which ... without a mate you can't reach. nice for those who are alone. the city, passing hours jump right and left to find pieces of plastic even on the roofs. there is plastic everywhere. in the middle of the game you will find yourself throwing the plastic out of the bow, you will have so much of it that you will have to dispose of it. the objects ... break in 2 minutes counted flat. 5 hours of farming for a spear, 2 minutes to break it. it breaks with every action, even hitting some cotton will break it. not to mention the rats and robots that spawn endlessly as soon as you turn the camera. I mean, I'll be honest I could go on for hours ...perhaps a concept is not clear to you. they've sold thousands of copies, we're talking millions of dollars, and the game isn't worth that much. I'm sorry, but for me it's a big No.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 31 Temmuz 2022I've played this game a ton. I've done at least 4-5 playthroughs, one being on hard mode that got stuck while we waited on the final chapter.I want to say yes, I recommend this game, but frankly, I find it hard to.Pre-Final Chapter? Certainly. I enjoyed the game a lot for what it gave and what little story there was.Post-Final Chapter? No.For a game that got stalled almost 2 years, the lack of content for the last push was noticeable. Ya, it was long, but that's because it was padded out by unnecessary ninja warrior style puzzles. And the sudden intro of bosses just felt jarring and unneeded.I don't want to give spoilers, but the final location gives you blueprints that are basically useless. There's 0 play value beyond the final island unless you plan to just work on your raft some more, so why in the world would you hand us the Titanium weapons at the literal end of the game + a couple of other blueprints for the raft that might have been useful had this not been the literal LAST island in the game.I just feel like there should have been at least one more location added, before the final area, that gave you these weapon blueprints so you could actually use them.On top of all that, the re-write of the overall story of the game felt weird. Having a rather minor NPC mentioned turn into the big baddie is fine, but having all the characters you randomly collect so you can play them just felt disjointed, since the whole point, at least to me, was traveling and chasing the supposed humans. Now we have random humans living on Balboa, Tangaroa, etc.If it's on sale, buy it. But don't pay full price.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 31 Temmuz 2022I really hate that I feel compelled to write a negative review for this game. Before the introduction of Act 3, this game was sitting in my top 10 favorite games to play.Chapters 1 & 2:The game overall is an amazing survival game that is story driven. While you can mess around and ‘just survive’, the game makes you want to continue the story to be able to collect more crafting recipes and items while also learning about the lore of it all. While the game isn’t hard, it's not easy either (There are game mode settings like Minecraft’s difficulty slider if you would prefer a peaceful or a more challenging experience.). With each area you go to, you have to kind of prepare for each one by gathering resources and taking your time doing so. I felt like I could enjoy each area and everything that it had to offer while being able to experience the new items I could make after I would leave. The overall pacing just felt right…Then chapter 3 hit and threw all that out the window.Chapter 3/Final Chapter:I think it was because friends and I had been waiting for a year and a half for this update. Despite how many delays there were, we were hopeful that there would be a lot of content in this new update. While some environmental things were added like random sea animals (That you can't interact with) that would show up around your raft, a lot of act 3 felt like a majorly rushed platformer game. The first part of Act 3 has a cool mini-boss, but that's about all that it has going for it. Unlike Acts 1 & 2, I felt like we breezed through the entire last act without a second thought. There was no prepping needed. The second part of act 3 was just a baron winter wasteland that was empty with reskinned bears as polar bears and a new enemy that was more of an annoyance than a challenge. I think the part that really ticks me off about the entire update was the final part. The massive amount of platforming, the sheer emptiness of the area, and the awful boss fight that had friends and I saying “What the hell is this?”. The biggest insult was the fact that you would get blueprints for new items after beating the game.If you end up getting the game after reading this, just play until the end of act 2 and call it a day.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 25 Temmuz 2022Look. Let's talk brass tacks. What do you buy Raft for? Is it to survive on a raft? Yes. Is it to play a survival game? Yes. Do you expect some nautical themes, maybe sailing, maybe some boat stuff? Yes. Sadly, Raft only delivers on two out of those four. Crucially for me, Raft has an issue where the sailing feels very simple (the wind never changes, so no reason to even move the sail much), and it places a massive emphasis on gameplay elements that are frankly bad, mainly the combat. The combat in this game is extremely basic involves hitting with left mouse key, and jumping around the enemy to confuse the AI. That's it, from the beginning to the end. Unfortunately, there are way too many instances in this game that requires combat, including the ending of the game, which is to the detriment of the entire experience. It is also a real shame that sailing doesn't require much skill or effort.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Temmuz 2022Its enjoyable right up until the final chapter, they got very very very lazy, needed to end it with a really fun addition, but this was a joke.

Did you spend all the money you earned between this and last chapter? nothing left for the finale?  Lazy lazy lazy lazy devs.You can beat the final chapter in probably 20min or less, however the only thing that can slow you down are a myriad of same ol puzzles rehashed.  and a boss thats purely frustration.    But in reality once its done and you realized it was likely 20min of content had you not fallen so many times.Game had promise,  Devs got paid and said #%%@ it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 Temmuz 2022The game would be fun if not for the helpless amount of annoying gameplay designs and raft collision glitches.The Shark never leaves you alone, even when you kill it, another one spawns in less than a minute making gathering underwater resources extremely tedious. This is a bit better if you craft a shark bait, but getting the appropriate fish for it with the fishing rod can either go to ways. You get two of the required fish OR You literally use up your entire fishing rod only to not get any of the fish you need for the recipe.While on the topic of enemies: Boars are the worst ive ever seen in this game.They do a wind-up animation before charging at you, when they stop they have a bit of a cooldown before they charge again... Now wait, you may think that there is nothing wrong here but no, I haven't said the most important part yet.The Boars cooldown period gets cancelled as soon as you hit it. Making itinstantlygo into wind-up, where it follows you like a laser pointer. So going left or right doesnt let you dodge the boar. Making you have to back away as soon as you hit the boar, only to pray to god that you got far enough away so you can dodge his ♥♥♥♥♥' overwatch tracer lookin ass dash attack, also did i mention it has almost the same amount of HP as the shark and that getting hit by it makes you get dragged along with it?The game is such a grind that I don't feel like im progressing at all.The rate of Food/Water reduction is way too fast meaning you literally have to eat something every 2 seconds with most of the food giving only a tiny bit of a help. Fruit being literally the worst food, since it only removes your thirst and a tiny bit of food. Boiling saltwater and drinking it is way better than planting and harvesting (for example) watermelon.I've been playing this game for around 5 hours now and I still have not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a single better tool. (Only got 1 Metal Bar)Also the amount of times I've been semi-launched or pushed off my raft when docked by an island is immense.Everything is fine until the weather becomes a tiny bit worse. And that happensA LOTThis game would have been fun if not for all this annoying ♥♥♥♥. Too bad I can't refund it anymore.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Temmuz 2022I bought this game when it first hit early access and thought it would be a great game if it ironed out the grind and fixed the bugs. Sadly with 1.0 nothing really feels new or fixed.The game really feels like its tailored to a multiplayer/co-op experience so if you plan on playing solo, prepare for an excessive amount of grinding, especially early game. Getting even basic equipment upgrades is almost a nightmare due to how hard it can be to find, especially when you have to deal with enemies, hunger and thirst chipping away at your resources at a constant rate. The degradation system means that a lot of your equipment barely lasts and requires going through the tedious steps just to replace vital equipment.Another problem is a lot of stuff never really got fixed from early access. If you lose your boat, you can't build a new one and you're basically screwed. The amount of grinding just to get started is just absurd. Even to get basic crafting components to combat the Shark attacks feels ludicrous. This are just a few examples of the numerous unfixed problems that never got fixed.The hard mode in this game honestly feels like a mistake. While the increased challenge is welcomed, the ""No-Respawn"" thing really feels like overkill. The game says that you can be revived by friends but if your solo, you will be relying on asking someone online to help, which in my opinion just feels like the game trying to force multiplayer on solo players. On top of that you can't even revert to an older save since the game marks your player for death. Save file editing seems to work to fix this but is still a really questionable design decision. This especially frustrating when your character dies to a bug.Overall, While a very interesting concept for a survival game, it does nothing new with the genre and falls into the many pitfalls that other survival games fell into. I'm sure many can extract hours of fun with friends but solo just felt like an absolute chore.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Temmuz 2022With random generation, and without a good soundtrack, story or world-building the game relies upon the raft building to keep things interesting; which it doesn't do very well.

I would liked to have spent more time with the game but I can't bring myself to continue playing it because it is too boring.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Temmuz 2022Strangest design choiceAfter I started my game and looted some mats, a shark attacked by raft. I grabbed some more mats and saw a small island. Since the shark already plugged 1 piece out of my raft, I made for the island. Then I wanted to build a raft. I created a hammer from my mats but found no way to build a raft.I had to search for reasons in the Steam forum and found that loosing the initial 2x2 raft screws you over permanently.While I can see few argument in favor of this design choice, IMO it makes absolutely no sense to not be able to build a new raft from scratch. The one I lost was already gone so I wasnt able to return to it. With no way to anchor the raft at the initial island, from a perspective if in real-life one was stranded on a 2x2 raft, every single person would go for the island and use his bare hands to anchor and pull the mini raft to this island.There should be either an option to anchor the initial 2x2 raft to the first island, an option to abandon the current raft and build a new one from scratch, or there should be a way to return to the raft or respawn it at your current position. Since none of these are true, because of such a strange design choice, I cannot recommend the game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 22 Temmuz 2022If you're not good at platforming games, this game billed as survival crafting is not for you.I adored the first chapters. I had a solo raft on Peaceful mode and a couple of different normal-mode rafts that I co-oped with friends. We had a blast. Granted, combat is janky as heck. But building is fun, exploring is fun, four of the five original story locations were fun (Balboa is a nightmare no matter how familiar you manage to get with the layout of the location). The bits of lore were interesting and believable, like an anthology of human experiences of this disaster that ended human civilization.Before the full release, I'd have recommended Raft without reservation. Unfortunately, the past few hours of gameplay have been disappointing. The revamped ""storyline"" takes the lore out of the realm of disparate but poignant human experiences and straight into cliched end-of-the-world movie nonsense. After all, why make the villain of the piece something relevant like loneliness or shortsightedness or an obsession with status, when you can just have one guy be both The Mad Scientist and The Demagogue and make him drive the whole plot?I've enjoyed aspects such as the added playable characters and raft equipment. The trade post is a nice idea, though the concept of using a form of money instead of a pure barter system feels silly. Mechanics such as getting buffs from food and drink similarly feel out of place. Varuna Point, the story location after Tangaroa which I waited for with much excitement, is unplayable if you aren't good at tricky platformers with clunky controls. I haven't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ any further yet.

The setting is nice, the story is good, the grinding isn't bad and the decorative options are nice. How much food and water you have to consume is ridiculously high and my 5 year old daughter can hold her breath longer than the protagonist, but I still loved it. Then...They completely lose all of my support with the last section. Without spoilers they took a game about crafting and exploration and took a wrong way left turn at Mirror's Edge drive, adding a very unforgiving parkour section while their 1st person movement... isn't great. They then sought salvation in the Legend of Zelda parking garage to finish it all. Combat is also really not a strength in this game. In the end everything started to feel phoned in once I hit the newer content. I'm very sad that such a good game came crashing down. Get it on deep discount.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Temmuz 2022this game is really fun if you have a fun friend group, otherwise it's a bit of a slog with a few egregious bugs and decisions for a game that's out of early access. to name a few:-running is SLIGHTLY faster than walking-seagulls are buggy (i've had many float off my raft after being killed, they phase through walls to get your crops, and once i had one get stuck in a death animation between my raft and the waters)-items you drop can sometimes phase through the raft itself-scrap hook isn't coded well. if an underwater collectible item (like scrap, rocks, sand, etc.) is high enough on the shore where you can stand instead of swim, you will not be able to mine it, only throw your hook at it. you have to be swimming to mine.-enemies can phase through geometry. i've had the shark bite me through the raft, as well as screechers phasing through mountains to hit me, and their rocks being dropped on me despite me being under cover-audio bugs; the ocean noises cut out suddenly once, and you can sometimes hear players collecting water even if you are not close to the raft.-(personal annoyance #1) bird nest, despite being a bird nest with eggs in it, is a way for you to reliably get meat and feathers. before update 9 in 2019 you used to get eggs from seagulls as well, but with update 9 came 'cluckers', which are chickens that you only get eggs from. the sprite has not been changed to reflect this.-(personal annoyance #2) the new characters you can play as are unlocked by going to story islands, even though these are just player characters with little to no lore.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 13 Temmuz 2022Went from a game I love to a game I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate. Jesus, always online if one thing, but the progression hold back for a game that keeps you in basically one spot now is some of the worst designed gameplay I have ever seen in a long while. branching out to just be able to enjoy the game is stunted to the point of high hell if you die. Stone is a huge hold back, and the fact you cant pick it up off an island main shore, rather you have to swim for it?

"Yayınlanma: 12 Temmuz 2022One of the most frustrating games I have played. The first few hours are fine as you progress through the crafting tier (if not extremely grindy constantly getting the same food/water over and over), but eventually you have to craft a radar and antennae in order to find new and larger islands and it ends up being seemingly impossible to navigate to some of the new islands.

"Yayınlanma: 11 Temmuz 2022Interesting idea with poor mechanics and boring systems. The annoyances I had in the first 3 hours never got better, and the only way I could enjoy playing this game at all was modding away many of the worst systems.Also - the game is confused on what it's trying to be. Is this a survival game where you craft bigger and better structures (Valheim, V Rising)? A punishingly difficult one where just surviving is the challenge (Frostpunk)? One with an interesting story to uncover? It fails at all of these equally - the survival systems require too much time investment to build anything of note (and the material costs are very high). It requires long periods of busywork to stay alive on Normal... so, it's difficult in that sense but not rewarding for doing it. And the story is not worth the time spent.- Resource gathering just isn't tactile or fun. As a counterexample: I weirdly enjoy chopping down trees in Valheim. It's tactile and just feels kind of 'good'. V Rising's combat and movement is fun, so gathering resources is generally OK. Raft is none of these things - resource gathering (clearly part of the core gameplay loop in a survival game) is quite tedious. Throwing a hook, pulling it back, over and over and over is not fun. It feels like a class project for an computer science intro course. It really doesn't get much better once you have nets or better hooks either.- Combat is brutal. Others have covered this, but if the shark is a core gameplay mechanic, it should not take several minutes of precisely timed attacks to kill it. The hitboxes are aweful, the game frequently skips frames when the shark is attacking (I assume they lock the game state to update the attack registration), it just makes it maddeningly annoying instead of a rewarding challenge. As a Dark Souls vet and lover I can confidently say this is not a skill gap issue but a poor implementation of combat.- My first save got lost after two hours because I decided to go near an island that looked cool. It had a bird on it that killed me instantly. I respawned and was immediately killed again, losing my paddle. After a few attempts of making a run for it (impossible given the movement of the raft) I tried to load an old save - however, as my paddle was now gone, I could do nothing but drift repeatedly to my death. So, two hours lost to poor game design.  This happened in my other save and I just used mods to move my raft. IOW - the game will break your save occasionally through poor design.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 8 Temmuz 2022The survival and base-building aspects are fun. The moment you start to follow the story the game losses any sense of fun. For a game about being on a raft they make you get off the raft to search island after island with scavenger hunt style quests. Every single story location is an increasingly frustrating and bigger version of ""find 5 things and bring them to place, then find 5 more."" Once you figure out this mechanic is the game's only trick you start to dread following any more story. You could ignore it... but then there isn't really much else to do.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Temmuz 2022TLDR: Angry review.I love this game and it's really fun to play both with friends and alone. So far, I had a great time - until now. I just got to a new large island where a Screecher just keeps obliterating me. Arrows go right through it and it hits me with its rocks from 10 feet away. I can't even kill it in melee. This clearly is a bug. I lost a great amount of gear trying to get at least some ressources of this island. It's not gamebreaking but since Raft was the first game I really enjoyed in a long time, this just frustrates me since now I'll play the rest of the game keeping this in mind and having to carefully think about bringing gear or not.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 7 Temmuz 2022Overall this is a pretty good game but mid game can get really boring unless you are doing the story. At the beginning of the game you have a small raft with a shark that follows you and will attempt to destroy a piece of your raft every once in a while. This gives a sense of danger and makes you want to expand your raft putting your most important structures in the middle away from the edge. This is great but once you put metal around the edge of your raft. All of that goes away and now you dont have to deal with shark at all unless you fall in the water. So now you are just drifting through the water bringing up resources not having to defend against anything and this begins to get boring fairly quickly. It would be great if there was some other type of enemy or enemies that i would have to worry about. Like maybe another shark that can destroy the metal frame and then the normal shark will attack the wood or even better they could add raft pirates. That will try to jump on your raft and attack you or destroy pieces of it to steal the resources. This would give you a reason to build up more and have to defend against more besides just the animals that are only on the story quest islands. Which you usually are on for only an hour or two if that because there isnt that much to do on them. Like i said before everything else is great but i dont think i can recommend this game sense it gets boring on the ocean and thats where you spend most of your time.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Temmuz 2022The early game in this just effing sucks. Really, really sucks. I'm guessing all the people who gave it good reviews, which is most of them, have more patience for pointlessly obnoxious BS than I do.In order to survive your first day, you have to gather enough ocean garbage (whee!) to build out your raft a little, build a water purifier, build a cook fire, make several tools, and so on. After about 7 tries, I give up. You can't pull in enough materials from the raft to pull this off, so you have to jump in and swim (or get lucky finding barrels I guess) but there's a shark with nothing better to do than follow you unrelentingly just because eff you. So it'll kill you if you try. Then you lose 2/3 of what you're carrying. Avoid the water, and you won't get the materials you need and starve. IT. SUCKS.I guess I could try an 8th or 9th time and build a storage container very first so that when I die I don't lose as many things, but honestly, think about how retarded it is to plan for and expect death in the first 10 minutes of a SURVIVAL game.There's probably a lot of game here, judging from the screenshots, but IDGAF. I'm stopping now while I can still get a refund.It might suck so hard because they tuned everything for multiplayer and I was playing solo, but honestly, I hate that. Stop doing that, companies. It sucks. Detect that I'm playing solo and adjust accordingly.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 5 Temmuz 2022POSSIBLE SPOILERS:I actually LOVE this game. Hours pass in what seems like minutes. Nearly everything is done brilliantly and in such a satisfying way. When they brought out the 1.0 update I was SOOO excited. Unfortunately there are a couple of gripes that lead to my ""negative"" review. Apart from little annoyances such as the recycler having to add 1 item at a time and having to spam the ""E"" key,  adding the titanium too late to the game, kinda, I was at the last location before realising you could dig up titanium ore and some other little gripes. My main gripe is the ending/last location, it just doesn't seem like ""Raft"". I always liked the idea that there was never anyone around and you were always searching 1 step behind others, then they introduced random characters at the end of each location, but the last ""boss"" was just rubbish, the puzzles with the gears was just annoying. Everything up to that point was brilliant, but that ruined it for me. I had saved up a huge bunch of materials to do a big fancy build of my raft but the ending just makes anything after so pointless.Hopefully they bring out more, such as DLC or something and I can go back, but as it stands, the ending ruined the whole experience and I would have preferred no ""boss"".",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Temmuz 2022The gameplay loop is enjoyable once you get past the initial resource drain/learning curve.  However, at this time there exists a bug in this game where, to avoid spoilers, a certain critical and very resource-expensive component of your raft just simply disappears. There is no mention or acknowledgement of this bug by the dev team that I could find (i could be wrong, i just didnt see any on their support page or steam forums), and unless it is fixed I simply cannot recommend this game. Seriously game breaking for me as its not only extremely frustrating to have to replace this thing every couple of hours but the lack of acknowledgement and/or remediation is  really disappointing.  I was looking forward to finishing my playthrough but after the last time my ship part mysteriously vanished I cant seem to bring myself to care anymore.TL:DR - game breaking bug not being acknowledged/fixed by devs makes the game quite unenjoyable. Wait to purchase until its fixed.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Temmuz 2022""One of my favorite ""survival"" games. Very relaxing once you get the hang of it, with a pretty tense early game (if you are playing solo) just to gather resources, learn what does what, etc. After that its all raft-building and managing really. Reinforce those raft parts and forget about that shark later on, huzzah!Don't expect a ton of challenges, but the story itself is nice and interesting, with quite a few cool places to explore and bits of information to discover.Great game for what the developers intended, definitely recommend it!""That was my original review, but after playing the ""final chapter"" I can't really recommend it anymore. The game goes from a tranquil survival game to a pretty poorly done puzzle / platformer  experience. Pointless mechanical boss fights? check. Horrid puzzles and sketchy jumping?check. Up until the final chapter it was an enjoyable game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Temmuz 2022Raft is pretty niche. It can be enjoyable at times but most of the gameplay is boring and slow. Raft feels like it's built around multiplayer than single player. It leaves me with a sour taste. If you ever play this game you will have a better time playing with just one other person. Playing this game solo is incredibly boring.I will say that the concept of the game is really good. Stuck in the ocean with only yourself and a raft is a very intriguing concept and how one will get out of that situation but my main gripe with the game is how the game is solely based on the story progression and how it detracts from the ""open world experience"". Great concept but bad execution.The base game is that you are stuck on a raft and it moves through a endless ocean. There are resources you can collect in the ocean and you can also find islands to explore with resources. No matter where you are at in progression you will still never have enough resources, you will have a easier time getting more in late game but you will always be out for more. Raft is ""open world"" but the exploration isn't exciting at all once you realize all of the islands are identical with the same resources such as flowers,trees,fruit and metals. The combat isn't good at all and feels very clunky, the hit-boxes on enemies are awful but combat isn't the main focus so I'll let that slide.There are several gameplay loops, and most of them are trying to keep you engaged. Always needing to eat and drink, This gets easier to control later in game but the food/thirst drain declines too fast. There is also a shark that will be around your raft and even if you kill it, it will re-spawn in like 1 min. It will also attack your raft. At first this doesn't sound too bad but it's just another annoying gimmick to annoy you and keep you occupied.Overall, the story feels disjointed. It's a series of islands you go to pick up a note part of the story. Once your done with the story there is like nothing else to do. The newest story addition features puzzles and 2 bosses, that are way too tedious and boring. Most of the new locations didn't contain anything interesting. Disappointing...In short, this game fails to bring a good experience. It is too tedious and lacks any sandbox elements that are fun that much better survival games include. Most of the gameplay will be struggling to the endgame and even 10 hours later you will still need more wood. If you like spending a eternity waiting to drift to an island for some sand then consider this game. It's more enjoyable with friends but it still lacks gameplay elements to have the motivation to play.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 4 Temmuz 2022Raft is a survival game where players must collect resources and build their raft to survive in the middle of the ocean. Unfortunately, the game falls short in several areas that detract from the overall experience.One of the most significant issues with Raft is the performance problems. The game suffers from frequent frame rate drops and long loading times that can make the gameplay frustrating and unenjoyable. This issue can be especially noticeable in multiplayer mode, where it can be challenging to keep the game running smoothly.Another issue is the repetitive gameplay. Collecting resources and crafting items to build the raft quickly becomes monotonous, and the lack of variety in the gameplay can make it feel like a chore rather than an engaging experience.Additionally, the lack of clear objectives or story progression can make it difficult to become invested in the game. While the game does offer some objectives, they are often vague and don't offer much incentive to continue playing. The lack of a compelling story or interesting characters can also be a turn-off for some players.Overall, while the concept of Raft is interesting, the performance problems, repetitive gameplay, and lack of clear objectives or story progression make it difficult to recommend this game to anyone looking for an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience.",N/A

AEO during a boss battle. I am so pissed at how horrible the last chapter is in this game. It is such a huge let down. Don't bother.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 30 Haziran 2022This game has the potential to be interesting and fun, but is littered with obnoxious ""puzzles"" that are just difficult to be difficult. They are infuriating, purely luck-based, and obnoxious as ♥♥♥♥. Save yourself some time and pass on this one.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 30 Haziran 2022finished story, its kinda mid. combat is still awful, building is cool but just has no real application bc u survive a lot longer than u usually need to build stuff for. completed the whole campaign and barely found enough titanium to build any of the stuff i unlocked during it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Haziran 2022Weirdly, I really enjoy this game, especially with a friend. The reason I just can't recommend it is there are just too many flaws. The combat is dreadful, glitchy and tedious. The progression is often gated behind combat, so can really feel irritating when the pig slides sideways to hit you even though you sidestepped it or your spear fails to register a hit for the umpteenth time. The large birds dropping rocks on you are a constant source of aggravation for no reason, they don't give you anything worthwhile for killing them, are a horrifically dull fight due to the poor bow mechanics, their glitchy flight paths, clipping through mountains, and excessive health pool. Even ignoring them is irritating as they'll constantly see through everything to zero in on you and drop rocks, tanking your hp.The raft part of the game is fun, sailing around, fishing, boiling seawater. Fighting off the shark attacks (though killing it does not make it go away for a reasonable amount of time, so another issue there). The strongest parts of the game are spent on the open sea, collecting flotsam.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Haziran 2022Its not bad, but kinda boring and grindy until mid game.

There's a rhino shark boss fight that I really really hated, just was not fun at all.Its nice in that there are no bugs that I found, and playing with friends was smooth and seamless. I just did not like the content in the game.If you want co-op survival, play The Forest, or Ark. Or subnautica for single player.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 29 Haziran 2022Solo play review - repetitive game play. And the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Shark is like the end game boss from start to finish. Its like every 5 minutes stop doing everything you are doing and go tend to this. Its like those games that force a sleep cycle - where you cannot play without having some time passed by as part of game mechanics. The shark is easy to kill but it takes time - and no way around it, I haven't played it long enough to see if there are any weapons that one hit that thing.Great idea - but its not meant to be played by single player - you will be bored to death and restarting over and over till you realize what is the point?",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 28 Haziran 2022Of all the games I have ran on my computer, and that's easily more than 200, this is the only one that managed to crash the whole PC while trying to join another player's world.The first few times it crashed alongside Discord, but I figured I could just try again and it would work sometimes and load the world correctly, so I could still play it.As of today, the whole system crashed at the same point where only the game and maybe Discord usually did during loading, and I had to restart the PC, as nothing else would work.All my specs are well above the recommended ones, and as no other games have managed to do this, I don't believe it's a problem with my PC.It's just not possible to gamble with crashing my system every time I load into a world, so unfortunately, until I hear this specific problem is somehow fixed, I'll have to stop playing the game.It's a shame, as playing multiplayer was actually kind of a fun way to kill some time.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Haziran 2022FALSE ADVERTISING!I like survival crafting games, this looked like a pretty chill game. It is not.

"Yayınlanma: 28 Haziran 2022Raft is released in a beta state. It's got way too much rough edges to be considered a complete game.The number of ""random"" islands you can encounter while floating is very limited (i think there's only like 4 small and 2 large islands?) so you quickly see repetitions.Endless nuisance from seagulls and sharks that you must put down whatever you're doing and respond within seconds. They are not realistic, they are not challenging, they are not fun. Just plain annoying. They are the worst part of this game.When you're hungry the game constantly (as in, with no delay in between) makes the stomach growling sound, extremely annoying. hard to believe this stayed for a game that's been in EA for so long.Combat feels like remembering how to cheese everything (because it's way too impractical otherwise).In general the game lacks directions telling you how it works, but none of it is for immersion or realism: the game makes it very clear with how recipes and research table works, that it is just a game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 28 Haziran 2022Games fine, but after reading this line of text from the Devs I could NEVER in a million years recommend this game to anyone.""In version 1.0, we blocked players who were not connected to an internet connection from playing."". They blocked people from playing a SINGLE PLAYER game from playing if they weren't online with an internet connection. Now I don't know about anyone else, but that is just asinine. I understand this game has online elements such as multiplayer, but that is just silly. And while they did reverse that choice, I still find it highly silly that this is even an issue with this game. They claim the reasoning is it caused bugs and issues, which sounds like a complete load.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 28 Haziran 2022Another survival game with the gimmick of being stuck on a raft, with a special shark who hates everything human built stalking you. After a good chunk of playing it in different stages of EA, I got bored and ultimately gave up after dying to the damn bird dropping rocks, twice in the span of a few minutes. FIghting a warthog was okay, but getting bombarded by the bird and instagibbed the very second after I respawned on my raft on other side of the island made me lose my bow and all the arrows, as well as nearly every other non common resource and my motivation to continue this bare bones survival with artificial difficulty that serves perfectly well as an ADHD test.",N/A

Nothing poses a threat to you once you learn how to easily avoid taking any damage from animals.

"Yayınlanma: 28 Haziran 2022After collecting resources and progressing through the story for a dozen hours, making a breakthrough to a new story island, seeing all sorts of new materials, creatures, scenery, when you really just want to embrace the nature of Raft and explore, you encounter a bear.The bear is easy to kill, barely even hurt you, and you get some good loot! You walk 15 feet down the path and find another bear but this one one-shots you from full HP without any warning wiping a few hours worth of materials out instantly, forcing you to leave the island behind to get more resources before coming back and repeating the whole process. This game can suck my left nut.Edit: After re-reading my review, I realize I come off as salty and one-dimensional in my complaints. The game has a small list of problems that I'm disappointed to see are still in the game upon full release.First, the technical problems. Everything is centered around your original 2x2 raft. If you get stuck on an island, you cannot even build a new raft, the game is not coded to be able to handle you creating a new raft so they don't even give you the option to do so. If you expand your original 2x2 raft into a 40x40, I hope you did so in every direction because resources spawn around the original 2x2. If you expanded purely to the right, you will see all of your loot passing you on the left. Sharks, the recurring enemy in this game, will only stay within a certain range of your original 2x2 raft. If you swim far enough away, suddenly the oceans are dead. If you are far enough away from your raft, like on an island as it sailed away, things will start to despawn, including the island you are standing on.Alongside this, inventory management is abysmal, its not always clear where resources come from (wool from llamas but not sheep?), and the lack of multiplayer scaling actually makes this game annoying to play with four people. There's just not enough resources to spread that thin.The game is solid, its high review rate reflects that, but I am very disappointed to see very obvious mistakes in the design of this game still reach full release.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2022It's a good game. Having played through it again since playing it in early access they've added a fair bit. The floating base idea is great and you can visually see your progression. I will warn though that this is the grindiest survival game I know of. You must do a lot of swimming because you need about 8000 calories a day and those calories take forever to catch and cook. The shark is a constant annoyance and basically serves to just keep you on the raft and slow down progress. I also don't get enjoyment out of the constant decay of equipment or the sky high recipe costs.So overall it's enjoyable but it's VERY grindy and could be a great game if they balanced some things or gave players sliders to decide how much time they want to waste but these complaints have been around since early access so I wouldn't count on it.edit: I'm changing this to a thumbs down after getting past where I ended in early access. The constant food grind is still terrible. I'm encountering regular gameplay bugs. Want animals? Better have them on the second story or they just disappear. Want to setup the radar? Hope you have a couple extra chests of wood to guess and check the requirements for placement in relationship to the radar. Want your engine to work? Hope you have less than 100 tiles and it doesn't bug out and stop accepting planks. Manage to kill a goat? The body just disappears before your eyes like you imagined the whole thing just like the one npc I've met so far.They decided to lean into combat and parkour which were probably the worst parts of the game previously. You used to be excited to go to islands and now they have birds constantly dropping stones on your head and a warthog who tries to kill you constantly like the shark. I killed the same rat with the jump attack run at you loop over 15 times at one of the story locations while going through one of the most boring linear collection quests I can remember in recent time. The game is just a mess, unfun, and should still be early access. The further I get into it the less fun it becomes with the only somewhat redeaming quality being the raft base building.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 25 Haziran 2022This game is honestly just not that great. It starts cute with you strugleing to get food and drink, improve your raft and discovering a few things. Than really quickly you start to figure out the game doesn't have more to offer than it gave you in the beginning except that you can do the same stuff in a slightly different way.Than there is combat, which is probably the worst. It is not difficult necessarily since every one of them basically requires you to run in a direction to prevent being hit and hit after they attack.  The enemies have a large amount of health requiring you to do the same boring combat for a long time and breaking your weapons you then need to craft again and again.The exploring of the islands is mostly walking and being annoyed by the next enemy you are going to have to spend the next 3 minutes killing.The best part is probably being on the raft expanding it slowly, but as already stated after the first few hours you can do everything you need to and new stuff is usually a slightly better but much more expensive way of doing the same thing. Making progress not feel really useful",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 24 Haziran 2022Personally, the gameplay isn't bad.  What gets to me, is to advance in getting decent tech you have to advance the story line.  I am totally in tune with that, until it gets to the point.  The point where it become the go to the 2nd floor, to go to the 4th floor, to go to the 3rd floor, to go to the 1st floor, to go to the fifth floor, go back to the 2nd floor.. .you get the jist.  Honestly though,  The game is solid.  The errors and bugs are minimal if at all.  My biggest issue is if you want anything resembling a decent raft, you'r stuck with hours of extremely convoluted puzzles, in the dark, all over creation, that are just at least in my opinion just too long winded for their impact.  Otherwise, I would actually STRONGLY suggest this game",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 Haziran 2022It's genuinely just too irritating to play. I spent like 5-10 minutes rowing towards a giant island in the distance, using all my materials, frantically crafting new paddles as they wore out, only to have it disappear right before I reached it. My experience has been full of moments like this where you're just annoyingly grinding but to no avail. It's just not for me. It's almost poetic that I am throwing in the towel 2.1 hrs in, making me unable to get a refund aha. I guess I'll play in the sandbox mode for a while to get my money's worth.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 Haziran 2022This is a great game for the first few hours. Collecting resources and trying to survive on the open ocean is a great concept and was one of the only games we played as a family but the ending is what destroys this game. *spoilers ahead*The ending was not worth the time and was anticlimactic for all of the overly tough parkour and the seemingly unwinnable boss fights in a game that was not designed for combat by any means. We found it hard to kill the rhino shark and that was in peaceful because the rhino shark yeets you that far from the bubbles that you die and that's not even counting the damage from the initial impact! Most of the fight was spent figuring out what to do but ended up looking it up on the internet. We also began chapter 3 from a save that was at the end of chapter 2, so we had no characters unlocked. This point is minor but I don't want to sail from the Utopia to the radio tower then to bear island just for playable characters! I would recommend starting from scratch if you already have a saved game. The final chapter also seems rushed with a last minute addition of an antagonist and a bs story line in the Utopia where Olof has 100s of hyenas... I just didn't understand it at all...I loved this game at the very start but began to dislike it the more I played. If you want survival, this is the game for you but if you want an in depth story that is a blast to play through, don't buy it.And also the grind for titanium is a pain in the ass.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 11 Haziran 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiFirst of all let me say that the concept of this game is wonderful and visually it is beautiful, but add me to the camp of people who desperately WANTED to like this game. I think with added controller support - and there is none - would make this game much more enjoyable. I have played many games with a keyboard and mouse, but this one just seems counter-intuitive. Switching between items and tools quickly is essential and while there are hot keys for doing this, both of my hands are usually engaged otherwise. So you can use the mouse wheel to the same effect, but this is clumsy and poorly executed.Now as far as game mechanics, there seems to be a lot of wasted opportunity. The shark,the major enemy when you start the game, is programmed to attack you every five minutes.When you START YOU ARE GIVEN A FOUR SQUARE RAFT, A HOOK, AND NO TUTORIAL.The first shark attack comes five minutes in - before you have learned how to play, or how to build tools and weapons to defend yourself. This means you are likely to lose at least one or two squares of your raft pretty quickly. The shark destroys your raft.Wood is a prime commodity, especially at the beginning, so constantly losing it to repairing parts of the boat you already spent resources to build is very defeating. There are beautiful islands to explore, but there isn't really anything of use on them until you are far enough along in the game to need to worry about the aesthetic of your craft, assuming you keep the shark from eating it long enough to build something worthwhile.Overall, this game was frustrating and disappointing. I loved games like Stranded Deep, Green Hell, Windbound, etc; all games that lead me here, but this was sadly disappointing.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 11 Haziran 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiCan't really recommend it at this point. Feels far too grindy compared to other survival games like Grounded and The Forest. Durability of equipment too low, crafting in general requires too many materials, and gathering constantly feels repetitive, like you're going back for more of the same stuff you've already gathered tons of.I suggest adding support for mods and stuff to be able to tweak those values, or adding some modifiers in the game itself or something.Otherwise, I enjoyed the game a lot before I got burnt out from the grind.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 10 Haziran 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiNeeds more than just a bit optimization.The performance is so utterly bad, especially in multiplayer, that the game is practically unplayable at times. When just floating on the sea the performance is alright, around 40fps. But when I get close to big islands it drops down to about 20fps in singleplayer and about 8 in multiplayer. With big story islands like Varuna Point it's even worse. Here it drops down to about 2-3 fps in both single and multiplayer. Wouldn't call that playable. The performance wasn't particularly good before the 1.0 update but the full release worsened it quite a bit from about 40fps on big and story islands (in singleplayer as well as multiplayer) before.Specs for reference:GPU: Nvidia RTX 2070 SuperCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600RAM: 32GBDisplay: 2560x1440@144hz",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Haziran 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiBeen playing this since the Early Access and got all the way to the end with some friends. Honestly, I wouldn't have paid for this. It's boring, repetitive, and an overall grind--- not even the fun type of grind either, but just an aimless one. The 'content' update was just a quick way for them to get this game off their hands--- the boss fights were pretty lame and over too fast to even be called 'bosses'. Endgame puzzles were nothing more than fetch quests from one end of the island to the other. The voice lines weren't even really necessary either, just something that seemed tacked on to make it look like there was more to the update than there was. We all waited more than a year for an hour worth of mediocre game play.In short, if you want a meaningless grind floating around on the ocean waiting for the same copy pasta island, go ahead and get this game. Otherwise, go spend your $$ on something that has more to offer.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 24 Mayıs 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiso i did finish the game and i find some of the core mechanics interesting enough. but after awhile every challenge either becomes meaningless or it remains annoying.the shark at the beginning of the game that eats your raft, meaningless after you armor your raft, and once you have a bow you can shoot it before it attacks you and it circles around for another go.the more important tools break after a couple uses. i was able to build a large raft with 15 tree pots, i cant cut all of them down twice before the metal hatchet breaks. this is annoying. cant use the shears more than a couple times before they break. tools break way to quickly.the recycler is annoying because it can take dozens of the simpler smaller items to fill it up and you have to put them in one by one. this takes forever. after awhile you will be replacing nearly every machine you have and just throw them overboard because you cant recycle them.depending upon what you put it in you will have to replace/recharge batteries very often running back and forth between the chargers and the machines. depending on how you build your boat this can be very annoying. there is a system for water to be provided to sprinklers automatically why cant we build wires between machines to keep everything charged. have enough copper laying around for it.if you are trying to build a large ship you will run out of wood very often. again annoying. i have chests of plastic that has little or no use outside of recycling. would be nice to be able to use it to build some walls floor or whatever.the number 1 thing thats annoying is this game was designed for multiplayer first. i dont play with people so am stuck with losing my entire inventory when i die. why it doesnt just drop on the ground i dont know, guess it made too much sense.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Mayıs 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhilst this is a nice game, it's relaxing, easy to play. It lacks objectives.It's nice that you can sail from island to island, stop and explore them and loot anything there. Sadly there are only a few different variants of islands, so if you go sailing for an hour and stop at each island, it feels like you are going around in circles as the islands are the same.The hawks on the big islands are just annoying, even if you are running and they drop a rock on you from really high up, it still hits you perfectly as if it's a guided missile.The shark that is forever your friend glitches through the sea floor on the islands, so whilst you are grabbing loot off the floor the shark can just pop up from the ground and injure you.The game is nice and fun, but once you have built the base layer and armoured it, there is no challenge. Can build the boat up and up but what else do you do? I've build a huge boat, but didn't know what to do after that.The objectives/story line are few in number, so once you have done them, built your boat up a bit, what is there to do? Nothing really.It's a nice game, but it get's old fast sadly.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 3 Mayıs 2022Initially I thumbed this game down due to it's very slow development progress. Mere weeks later, the devs finally finished the game. Fantastic! Time to alter my review...Sadly I still can't recommend Raft. I was hoping that the finished game would mean controller support. Unfortunately, I was wrong.As somebody who has long term complications from a back injury, sitting at a desk, using key/mouse is not a comfortable experience. In fact it's agony after an hour or so.So if I want to play, I'm forced to precariously balance my keyboard and mouse pad, in a recliner chair if I want to play. Far from ideal, and also not comfortable.I just don't see why a fairly simple game cannot have native controller support? Those of us with injuries, disabilities, special needs would certainly appreciate it.",N/A

I am one of those people who believes cosmetic stuff is stupid.How about adding some items that actually have a point? Some stuff with stats? Purposes? Maybe even some mcguffins?And on top of all that, add some more GAME to this game. like I said its fun, but you can hit the wall of stuff to do in less than half a day.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 16 Nisan 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiUpdate to 1.0: None of the issues about optimization have been acknowledged or fixed in the game whatsoever. Please play this game with extreme caution if you have a newer GPU/CPU you'll most likely notice extreme spikes in temp even from just the start menu of this game.. even though much other games you play are fine, including other unity games.Aside from that, the overall play of the game is the same as before, but with more bloated story bits and pointless parkour ending. Its fun for what it is- usually just goofing with friends in multiplayer- other than that don't get your hopes up for much unless you like endless traash ocean and fishing, the chill vibe is there I guess. Because of that I just can't recommend this game.. content creators make it look a lot more fun than it really is.Original Review:-------Shorty Short: Recommended with a bit of caution. Its a fun game for survival enthusiasts who also like chill. Great with a friend/s, sometimes a bit lonely as a soloist. Careful if you have motion sickness, turn that on in the settings so the rocking waves don't get ya. Needs serious optimization as it runs too hard even on higher end computers (important note written further below). Tips on how to start/difficulty further below too.This game wears its heart on its sleeve. It is as you see it, lost at sea with minor guidance and a hook in hand with an angy shark trying to eat your boat. STOP EATING THE BOAT, BRUCE! Anyway, I find myself more amused by yelling at the only real friend you have in the game, a cranky shark, than anything else. The raft building can be fun at times though, especially if you have some whacky ideas.The exploration is a bit hit or miss, as the combat controls feel a little sluggish and things can hurt you pretty good. You'll find yourself battling your own hunger/thirst meter more so then anything else in game. The game is charming and is impressive for such a small dev team and they truly love their game as they've poured a lot of QoL changes, more content and more decorative things to amuse players with. There is a story you will follow and progress through, leading to some of the most useful equipment for your raft. The story is alright, you get a sense of what has happened and what people were trying to do to avert/avoid the crisis, as well as just survive after it. It seems they've been working on improving it and it shows in the latest update a bit.IMPORTANT NOTE: I would like to point out this game has some serious optimization issues. I would make sure your video card is limited to 60fps or so with this one as the physics engine could really use more tweaking. Unity can always be a bit of a hog, but Raft is a special case as you can even see in discussion topics. Raft can run my old graphics card harder than a modded Fallout 4 game with a lightweight enb, just sayin'. AND it seems to be even worse for higher-end systems, so thats a thing thats weird to say. So that is my hope to the devs; I love the game and have a lot more hours into it than on Steam, but please.. please please work on that optimization soon. I know content is important, but so is not melting down computers.Little tips for people wanting to check it out:If you go it alone- I recommend playing on easy as its a lot more manageable for your first couple of times playing, The shark can be your biggest obstacle or even smacking into an island and getting stuck WITHOUT a paddle or means to make one.. I personally usually play on Easy or Normal depending on my mood for solo games. You don't lose items on you if you die so its not such a chore if you do.With more experience as a Solo player, Normal mode is a nice challenge for those who would like the game to keep them on their toes even more. For the most part it just means the shark attacks more frequently and your hunger/thirst go down a bit quicker.. which can be annoying to manage early game and can easily end your run without it. You also lose anything on you when you die and have to respawn (in multiplayer a friend can drag you to bed so you don't lose items.. solo, well.. no friend, much loss.)For Multiplayer, I'd recommend Normal for starters and then eventually Hard if you really want it annoying. Babysitting the hunger/thirst stats more than anything else can get old after several, several hours of doing it, but the game feels too easy otherwise with 3 or more players if ""easy"" is something you don't like, that is.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 10 Nisan 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft is an unfinished game. The game consists of a 4x4 platform, with which you hook items in the never-ending ocean to expand your ""raft"" and find new islands and explore the 1/4th of a story it features. In it's current state, the game is unfinished, and offers little-to-none gameplay other than building. It is full of bugs, the graphics are not extremely good, and overall the game looks unfinished, and probably shouldn't have been released. On the other hand, it doesn't seem like the developers do much to update it anyways, so maybe they thought that it would be a good idea to release an unfinished project and charge 20$ for it?There is some gameplay, though, and it is possible to play lightheartedly with some friends, but don't expect anything special or over the top from this game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 19 Mart 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe survival meters drain too quickly and with all the constant minimalistic resource gathering you have to do it just gets anxiety inducing. It's the kind of survival game where your gear is always deteriorating so you have to constantly gather more resources to make up for the ones lost and over time it just gets tiring as progress feels slow.Also, when you want sand you have to find specific deposits around islands but you can't just heave a bunch into your bucket from the literal beach you're standing on. And in order to craft a furnace you need 7 bricks, 1 to research and 6 to craft, each requires 2 sand and 2 clay, so that means 14 sand and 14 clay that you have to find in small deposits around an island while having to fish a bunch of fish to craft shark bait to keep it off your back.And that right there is why I decided to stop playing. This recipe is bullcrap. The design logic behind the resource gathering is bullcrap. The amount of resources you need to gather (especially the fish for shark bait to keep it off you while try to desperately find these sand and clay deposits around an island) is bullcrap.And so before I can advance any further in the game I have to suffer through absolute bullcrap. And you know what? I'm not gonna. Cause it's bullcrap.Horrible design.If by magic a dev where to read this review: Make any sand and clay (land, dirt) gatherable, not just specific deposits around the water around the island.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 16 Mart 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is good but it takes sooo long to progress.The thirst and hunger bars deplete really fast and it feels as if most of your time is spent on getting freshwater and food. And because they deplete so fast, you need to be constantly collecting wood so that gets used up ridiculously fast as well.It gets annoying just doing that over and over and over.After a certain point, I just stopped playing because it got too tedious.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 13 Mart 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiTL;DR - Interesting the first few hours but gets really repetitive and boring after even if you follow the story. Enemies are real damage sponges, but 'gib you really quickly.The nice plus is you can play this game with others even if they have high latency connections. Gameplay is mainly collecting resources to modify your raft to follow the path for the story.On the side you get to visit a few islands and are constantly eating shark meat as the shark shows up non-stop throughout the game, which is a worry at first, but then a nuisance and waste of time later on.Combat is messed up as besides the enemies being damage sponges, they have broken pathing mechanics and will detect you from way too far away, or magically warp/teleport to hit you even if you try to grab cover. The enemies are a worry at first when you just have a pointy stick, but after you get iron spears and rock arrows it's pretty much can you kill them without them glitching out.Food and water become a non-issue later on, especially after you have several chests full of shark meat and multiple water evaporators. The hunger and thirst mechanics though are really annoying and probably need a tweak to how often you need to manage it as it just starts to get really tedious as you get further into the story and artificially inflates the difficulty.There's a good amount of non-story raft customization, you can change colors, add furniture, and there are wall and floor parts to design buildings. There is no automation outside of the collection of flotsam by nets on your raft that pick up items in your line of travel.While it may be completely playable, there's just too much that makes this game more of a hassle than an enjoyment to play, even with friends, which is why I am not giving this game a recommendation.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 10 Mart 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiI really like most of the game but the part I hated the most was the way death works and the shark because the only when you die you cannot get you items back unless you are playing online and it is a main part of the game to go underwater and get resources but then the shark comes and kills you the only way to avoid this is to kill the shark which takes a while or make shark bait and that also takes time because you have to get specific fish otherwise this game is fun and I really like it,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 5 Mart 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiI think other people might like the game more, but for me personally, I despise having the health and water timers. I don't mind cooking for buffs, like in Valheim, but having two little ♥♥♥♥ timers ruining every other bit of the game is annoying as hell.Out having fun exploring a tiny island? Oop, didn't cook anything on my ♥♥♥♥ fire in the last three minutes, better cut FUN short so I can run back to cook ♥♥♥♥ that doesn't even matter in the game.""But it's a survival game. You do realize you need food and water to surMRGLGLGLMFSONKIFKFN.""Don't even bring realism up when discussing this game. You start off on 4 wooden planks that magically have 4 pontoons on the bottom of them as a raft, and along with that, you have a giant trash-made hook on a rope, that you sling out and magically acquire plastic bottles, palm leaves and planks of wood.AND, for some reason, even though they're THE PUPPIES OF THE SEA, sharks attack your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little pontoon raft every 3 seconds until you get the upgrades later. None of that is realistic, and sharks don't do that.There is zero reason for the ♥♥♥♥ timers. You already got a shark eating your ♥♥♥♥, you have to bait it away if you want to go under water. Good enough for a timer.The islands are crap, and it's an exploration game. What, are they worried someone is going to just set up shop in one of the islands and just stay there? WHO CARES? It's an exploration game. People would get bored even in the robot city. There is ♥♥♥♥ all to do on those islands, and the ocean (due to your raft) is cooler anyway.And it's all ruined by an anti-fun timer waiting to slowly murder you if you don't build like 7 grills and just spam cook every other second. And that's on the easy difficulty, which I lowered it to to try to be less annoyed by the food timer.There is a mode that gets rid of the hunger issues, creative mode, but I still want to gather stuff. I would even still cook just for the hell of it, but there's no point because creative mode gets rid of everything related to gathering and exploration. There are no islands, no resources to gather, basically a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing on a flat ocean that doesn't move, but hey. you can build a raft that takes up the entirety of the game. Woo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hoo. Open water, no islands, no gathering, no nothing, and you. Whoop-dee-doo.I am going to see if there's a mod that fixes this, and even then I am leaving this review as-is since that's how the game came.Not only are there the problems I've mentioned, but there's something else that annoys me specifically about this game, and really it sets the tone for all of these types of games:The water purification. You spend all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time cooking water over a fire, and you get a single cup of water. Now keep in mind, this dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you're playing sits there literally fishing out ENTIRE PLASTIC JUGS all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ day, but because this game has ""realistic survival mechanics,"" PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT, your stupid ass character can't figure out to use the jug for water! It's adding insult to injury.You could do what they're talking about in warmer weather using plastics only, but that requires only warm sunlight. And they use a cup as a collector because it takes forever for water to evaporate, condense, and then drip into a cup. You only do that if you have no fire, but do have clear plastics (or glass). If you are using fire to boil water, their stupid ass doesn't need a small ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cup on either end. And you can't make the argument that ""well, that's all they have,"" because you end up making like ten of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ contraptions, it's absolutely asinine.AND STILL not only that, these idiots don't even know how the ♥♥♥♥ works! They have the unit EXPOSED TO OPEN AIR ON THE OCEAN! Did no one else see the problem with the ♥♥♥♥? Air blows away the steam! You would get almost nothing for your efforts, which is exactly what you get. It's the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ I've ever seen.And mind you, I would ignore all of this moronic ♥♥♥♥ if I wasn't on a literal anti-fun timer! And unless you find a cyborg stomach in your travels, while you'll have a huge stack of food at some point (I could do that now, it's just too annoying), you STILL have to do that annoying cooking sometimes and stare at your stupid timers. I've seen later that you get nets that basically collect everything for you, but who cares? I would rather go around collecting ♥♥♥♥ than stare at a ♥♥♥♥ timer, and even worse cooking and purification tasks. They're so boring and pointless for a game where you're Minecrafting ♥♥♥♥ with floating trash to make a raft empire. It's ridiculous.And another thing; your grill can only cook one thing at a time. What kind of stupid ♥♥♥♥ is that? It's a damn fire, you don't have to cook a single raw potato on a whole fire! So then you gotta build more of the ♥♥♥♥ if you don't want to spend 8 days cooking one potato at a time. And again, even if there's an improvement later, unless it's a Gordon Ramsey simulator added into the game, the need to cook and purify water in a boring way for a ♥♥♥♥ timer STILL ruins the fun of the game.0/10 because it annoyed me.",N/A

Let me play how I want.No option to unstick your raft when it clips into something and gets stuck, the unstick button only works on the character. This has happened twice, and once I had to deconstruct basically my whole raft to get it to unclip from what it was stuck in.The animals are just...irritating. Not challenging, not interesting, not fun. The shark is actually fairly well balanced, but the other animals are just a drag and make me want to shut the game off and go play something else.It's not a bad game, but there are so many little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like this that I never end up playing for more than an hour at a time before something frustrates me and I go to play something better.

I started and got stuck on a big island. I had to go on the island and run around trying to find wood as I had none when I got stuck to make a paddle. After finding some in the water I come back to the other side of the island to find that my raft is now gone even though I put down a rock bucket to weigh it down. So now I'm left with just killing myself to get back to the raft which only had a portion of my best stuff in it, the rest was on me because I was not expecting for it to float away. After making a new game and painfully going through the start again I got to the dome city and still I'm so bored hoping something interesting would happen.

"Yayınlanma: 20 Ocak 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiI wanted to finish this game so badly, and I am so disappointed that I had to quit because of game-breaking bugs regarding mob spawning, as well as weird gameplay choices that forced me to install mods.I ran into a known and apparently common bug where no bears and no boss mobs spawned on a major island. I then proceeded to two more islands (which should reset the original island and potentially fix the bug), and on the third island I also spawned absolutely no mobs, which are required for game progression. I was so frustrated I quit the game at this point, but I will mention the other things I experienced.My inventory screen is overlapped by the crafting screen on every resolution I try (from 1600x900 to 2560x1080, full screen or windowed). This issue is immensely frustrating, has multiple posts about it online, and has never been fixed. (Just let us click and drag the windows, then we could ""fix"" it ourselves.)My hook sometimes glitches out and gets stuck mid-cast. You can't harvest rocks with the hook if they are peeping out of the ocean or are on land, despite there clearly being areas in the game where they have been designed this way.Sometimes when you destroy a wall, you will get everything that was mounted on that wall back in your inventory (as intended), yet other times the mounted items will just disappear forever. Why? I save before I make any modification to my raft now because I'm so worried about items disappearing.The Screecher mobs, big flying birds that drop rocks on your head, are so awful that I had to install a mod to remove them. They are incredibly hard to hit with a bow and arrow (expensive to make), have an immense amount of health, come back like every minute and prevent you from doing things outside while they're around, and their loot is terrible.The shark respawn rate is far too quick. You kill the shark and it's back within three minutes. This is unrealistic and unfun. There is no mod I could find to change the respawn rate of the shark, so I just flat out had it removed too, which I didn't want to do.Please give us Steam Workshop support so that we aren't forced to use a website for mods that has no way to filter mods and no comment section.",N/A

I barely get to use anything in the game before it breaks restarting the grind to make another one all over again.The rats shouldn't respawn in the ship if I walk 15ft away. That's ridiculous. Got the engine but I think it's bugged out. It just baaaaarely rotates when switched on so I decided to move it to see if that was the problem but lost ALL my fuel when I moved it so I couldn't even use it! So I quit after that.Crafting requires far to many resources for stuff in my opinion. I hate slowly moving from place to place to find things then quickly consume them to build something that just breaks in a few minutes of use. The shark is sooooo annoying. Killing it just respawns another one in a minute or so. I liked the threat at first but it got old really quickly. It's always there. I mean damn give me a damn break and let me have fun with the game. That's like if Subnautica had a Reaper just follow you the entire game. I wasn't even intimidated by it after a while. It's just a major annoyance and the only thing the shark serves is to slow you down even more. The core game play loop is to just lose all your materials to thirst, hunger, the stupid shark, killing enemies for menial rewards, and spending a lot of time replenishing. Stop giving me shark heads and boar heads after every kill. Damn that's annoying.I played over 12 hours and never found out how to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ backpack. Where do I get wool ffs?! I found the leather by killing a boar, killed an alpaca... Nope. Tried to sheer it... Nope. Never once saw a sheep if there is one. I can't even capture animals because I never found the gun powder. Maybe it was later in the game. But damn that's a dumb idea because you run out of space just on one supply crate. You can't even use things in your backpack so don't even bother setting up a hot bar because you'll be switching out items every few seconds to use them. You can't move chests either which sucks.Building is a pain in the ass. The materials required to build is ridiculous. I grind for hours to get planks and plastic and use it in only about 5 minutes just making a wall around a small room. You can't move them once they are placed either. You have to destroy them and get half your materials back. EVERYTHING requires planks just about. I never have enough planks to build what I need. I have to grind for more planks all the damn time. Chopping trees is absolutely pointless. They give me maybe 5 planks and fill your inventory with crap I don't want and there are like 3-4 trees per island so wtf? My ax breaks quickly too.I didn't bother growing anything. I thought growing fruit would be a good idea... Nope. The fruit doesn't even recover enough health to be worth it. Doesn't grow back either. Also harvesting doesn't always give seeds so I have to stop at yet another island to get seeds. I just started dropping them when I got them. Growing trees is probably the biggest waste of time. It's just like any tree. Chop it down to get wood and fruit. You can't harvest it and wait for new fruit. You have to chop the whole damn tree down you just spent 20 minutes waiting to grow to get 1 measly coconut that recovers a sliver of hunger and thirst.  Also it's not guaranteed to get seeds so don't waste your time.The hunger mechanic sucks. It just sucks. My guy eats and entire shark and is STILL hungry after. Dude downs a shark, a cat fish, 20 potatoes, and about 12 steaks a day. I mean what the absolute ♥♥♥♥? Slow that down a bit. The water mechanic is much better balanced. I also love how often the fishing rods break... Even the metal ones.I see this game was received well. At first I could see why. But I'm disappointed. I don't understand why this game has so many positive reviews. There is no game play here after 3 hours. I played to long to ask for a refund but I regret playing this for so long. Also the development is dead. Too much time is wasted gathering materials and almost everything is the game breaks after a few uses. Maybe if I could repair it before it broke to save one materials it would be better. More then likely I will never play it again. Just way to slow paced.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ocak 2022Erken Erişim İncelemesiHm, this game still feels quite flat. It's not a bad game, just nothing exciting is going on in this game. It had quite an improvement over the years, when I first tried this game, but since then the core gameplay loop still is way more boring than it is in some other survival games. At least they implemented tons of decoration items, which some people may enjoy, but I personally can't get much excited for these. Visiting islands mostly feels the same so far, some flowers to collect, some trees to chop, some clay to dig, some animals to avoid or kill. Sometimes you will find containers, which is the highlight of the whole game.Anyhow, I will still keep playing further, since I have no good alternatives right now to kill some time, but I highly doubt the final release will be something I would spent hundreds of hours into, like in some other survival games.",N/A

At least I don't have to worry about getting it off the island.All this within first 30-something minutes.Maybe I should just pass by this damn island but if the very beginning of the game makes me restart a whole world after 10 minutes...I kinda don't feel like exploring more.I understand the game is in Early Access but somehow until now I played plenty EA games and none made me restart whole world 3 times, maybe just my luck?With that in mind - if I'm allowed to play, I'm allowed to comment and based on my experience: not worth it yet - refund.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 10 Aralık 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game has a lot of potential but its not ready to recommend to anyone unless you just like to farm endlessly to build your dream raft lol. The combat is an absolute joke. way to predictable and easy. The shark should be much larger and harder to kill. must of killed it well over 50times without ever dying. after putting in around 4k hours in RUST i can not bring myself to farm another damn tree or node or build any larger of a raft than what i need to obtain the gear and exact ammo i need to kill the what i need to. The game needs more content but the devs are horribly slow. i put in almost 50hrs and gave it a damn good try but after its all said and done im kind of sad i wasted so much time with this game. so many bugs. fell through the map on several occasions. luckily you just fall into the ocean and swim out of the island lol,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Aralık 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game has a fun and rewarding progression system in terms of crafting, but when you venture to gameplay outside of that bubble, it starts to have issues. Combat against the creatures that challenge you is stale and clunky at best, frustrating at worst. Furthermore, your survival within the combat side of the game increases with teamplay, but the problem arises where the more players you have, the less resources you can sustain. Without any significant updates to how combat works and actual incentives and/or changes for playing with others, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 29 Kasım 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft is a good idea that never manages to be more than that. The game has lots of grind, enemies that make you pull your hair out, and a progress tree that is infuriating to progress through. Very rarely in this game when you FINALLY get to a new tech on the tree do you feel it was worth it. And often times the new tech will not behave like you expected it to. For examples I finally unlocked the radio. I place it and it complains its to low, so I build a massive tower on my raft and slap it down on top of that, but then it complains it needs a battery, so I go figure out how to make that, then it complains it needs an antenna, so I figure out how to make that, then it complains it needs 2 more antenna, so I make those, then it complains the antenna need to be far apart from each other... This is the game it constantly wastes your time and upgrades don't feel good. Getting a radio should have been exciting and fun, instead it was just frustrating as the game had 5 other requirements for it to even work and it only told me each 1 slowly 1 at a time right as I thought ""Finally I am done!""In short Raft QOL is almost nonexistent.It's a unique concept though at least.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 1 Kasım 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiAll In all, it's a great game, with a LOT of potential for storylines, creativity, and more.. The only real issue is that you can finish this game (as it stands) in about 2-3 hours at most. Each ""chapter"" (there are only two so far) lasts for about.. oh 15-20 minutes. Everything else will be traveling between the story locations and gathering TONS of materials/food/water. If you're crazy, like me (and some others), you can stretch it out into oblivion by just letting your raft drift and focusing entirely on the building. This gets REALLY boring after a while, though. That being said, I would NOT recommend this to anyone who is looking for a long, exciting adventure. If you want more slow, chill, and constant annoyance from the shark... yeah. This is for you.**Note** You will notice a LOT of people complaining about others wanting updates, and to make it clear: these are people who most likely only play once in a while, or do little in terms of the story and focus on the creative side. Ignore them. The dev team may be small, but some kind of road map, plan, or even a projected release date for future updates would go a long way toward silencing players who call for updates.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Ekim 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis early access survival game clearly has not balanced the difficulty between single-player and multiplayer mode.Although it claims to be single-player support, the gameplay is totally unbalanced for single-player users like me.The life sustain system like hunger and thirst is so bizarre, that left you little to no free time between finding food and drinks. The character's hunger and thirst status depleted so fast compared to other survival game types.Which forced the single-player to either only choose the creative game mode for not so punishment game experience. Or continuous cycle of meaningless grinding 1) Food search> 2)Waiting for a meal preparing> 3) Hungry or thirsty again. Almost no time left for RPG experience like exploring the unknown or base building.At this moment this game clearly is a co-operate-only survival game.I have actually enjoyed playing some famous harsh game titles like ""The darkest dungeon"" but their game design is actually well balanced and the difficulty is acceptable.

I ran out of palms early on and missed a whole bunch of islands because I couldn't make an anchor and didn't want my boat to float away from me.

"Yayınlanma: 24 Ağustos 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI've had this game since it first came out on steam. It's been a few years and i've done full run throughs twice with and without co-op. I must say this game is no where near what I expected a 3-5 year game in development to look like. The latest addition was customization when this game needs more content and less ""Oh I can paint my boat a new color"". The threats like the shark are a TOTAL JOKE. This game is good for probably 10 hours before you realize how much ""nothingness"" there is.You will come to a point where you realize there really is nothing to do, I mean nothing. You get to the final destination and that's it. I expected a LOT more out of a sandbox game with this many years behind it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 23 Ağustos 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiBased on the overall reviews I expected a lot more, especially when coming from a game that costs even less and has so much more to offer (=> Valheim). The biggest issue is the huge grind. It's not like a nice grind that results in real progress... it's just the grind you don't want to have in a game because it feels like a lot of work with little rewards and no progress. The same is true for the ""mini-game"" that occurs every few minutes which is hitting the shark 3 times (later only 2 times) or having to hit the birds. It's not like a big world event with cool fights and different types of enemies, it's just having to click 3 times on the shark... every few minutes... again and again and again.I definitely see potential in this game, but instead of offering more cool items or simply better ones, everything is breaking all the time which results in even more grind.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 3 Ağustos 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiDon't buy this game.This isn't a survival game. It's an annoying game. Here's why:1.Hunger and Thirst are incredibly easy to fix, and also drain incredibly fast.2. There's no real challenge, so the game spams a shark after your raft repeatedly. You kill it? It comes back within about a minute and 30 seconds full health. Killing it is also really easy, you don't even need the bait. Grab a metal spear and jump in the ocean, then just hit it when it charges you with it's mouth open and you don't take damage. Rinse and repeat.3. Durability on all items is trash. So when your spear breaks and the shark is eating your ship, which it does often, you have to let it take the piece of the ship.4. All the AI go through walls and objects5. The only threat other than sharks is a bird that picks up boulders and drops them on you without making much sound at all. Just a brief ""caw"" in the distance, and no sound until you're getting squashed. You can just hold W in one direction and keep running and it won't hurt you though.6. There's only 2 islands in the game as far as I can tell. You just find them on repeat and pretend they aren't the same as the one you just left.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 10 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiYou spend most of your time trying to keep yourself alive, which is great for a survival game. What's not great is how your limiting resource isn't actually food or water, it's wood.You need wood to repair your raft, to boil water, and to cook food primarily, which again doesn't sound so bad until you realize that growing food also means boiling water. Almost all your BREAKABLE tools also require wood. So your number one limiting resource just goes back to wood, wood, and more wood.That got dull really quickly for me.Your hook for obtaining items should at least be a permanent, unbreakable tool since you're really kind of screwed without it. I don't think a game that's built around active gameplay should really involve such tedious resource management.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI want to love this game. As someone playing this solo-no wiki/faqs on normal difficulty - my world name is Wilson - I have found the last update to be very frustrating.  The large islands with both boars and rock eagles introduced to the player(s) at the same time is what got me to uninstall the game and sit this renovation update out. <insert Seinfeld walking out of movie theater.gif> There's no armor you can wear so 5 hits and you are dead. The boar and the rock eagle are like tag team wrestlers each can take 10 plus hits to kill it seems... and I had an iron spear and iron arrows.Plus, when you die your gear doesn't exist for you to retrieve - it's just <peace out and disapear.gif> gone. The water bottle and flippers that I invested an hour plus to get between shark bait fishing, reef resource getting, smelter making, and vine goo making are gone. Given the save system being tied to the world instance savescumming isn't an option. It's easier for me to take a break and restart from the beginning again like permadeath. So - I restart, get back to this point, and I get wrecked again. I'm out.I like the investment asks the game makes of the players over the updates but the combat/death mechanics just feel very bolted on to give streamers with five pals something to showboat at the expense of people that only solo and want to figure stuff out on their own. I'll check it out again come Update 14 but please Redbeet ramp the difficulty for solo players or provide armor crafting / item recovery mechanics.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 5 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game is fairly straight forward, and doesn't seem to change much. I got pretty bored after essentially building the titanic as my raft.

Encounter a boar? You can't choose to ignore it, you must kill or run. To kill it takes enough time to significantly drain your hunger and thirst meters.

"Yayınlanma: 2 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesi12.7 Hours at the time of playing and We have tapped (my group of 3-4) the endgame. If we continue to play, it will simply be to make a decorative Raft but I really don't think that's gonna happen. Read below for why.Preface: Luckily we got the game on sale for about $15.00 CAD during the Steam summer sale and if I can get 1 dollar per hour of worth from a title then I am pretty happy (obviously I want a lower dollar per hour value but I'm happy with a base line of a dollar per hour, especially during this current game drought due to Covid)Now.... The game is intrinsically fun, but tedious. A lot of people complain about game play tax mechanics like drinking and eating in other survival games. Well this game takes it to a new level. From completely full food and water bars to warning level levels its about 10 minutes at best. 5 drinks of water to fill your water and 3-4 medium fish to fill your food.  Go AFK at your own peril. I pity the solo players. Also if you die and don't get put in a bed by another player you lose everything on your body. Our group was constantly fishing, boiling, cooking and replacing. Think you got it easy cause you built your first fishing pole. Well you get about 10 casts at best before it breaks. Whats worse is that you'll probably catch 2-3 large fish you can't cook on a standard grill. We found ourselves constantly running out of planks if we went to an island and constantly running out of inland resources when we went to open water. It all does get easier as you expand your raft and get collection nets but its very end game and if your living on easy street then you probably are just about finished with the game in its current state. Also as an end note the costs of things is ridiculous. A basic fishing rods takes something like 8 planks but chopping down an entire tree will get you 4 planks. So it takes 2 trees to make a single fishing rod in real life a fishing rod can be made from a sturdy branch if needed. A metal spear takes 2 Iron ingots.... 2 iron ingots for a metal spear head.... Are we welding them together? Not much thought has been put into the balancing and if it has its all been logistical and not logical.Overall the game needs a bunch of work to add more content and change the mechanics, including a much needed better fishing mechanic. The fishing could be an entertaining advanced part of the survival aspect but nope. Cast wait press LMB when it tells you and you got some kind of fish.... lame.Looking forward to seeing how this game progresses. Do not buy it unless some significant time has gone by since my review, or if you don't mind a game delivering >15 hours of game play, or you enjoying constantly running out of food water and tools to the point where you would rather take a cheese grater to your forehead then build one more fishing pole.",N/A

It's a real bummer and just so much time wasted.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 2 Temmuz 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI'm somewhat tied as to whether I would recommend it or not. I was leaning towards a yes, but it is early access and content feels limited and almost like there's only one thing to do. If i hadn't already committed to buying it, I would probably wait a while to get it. I played solo, and if I were to restart with friends I would not do anything differently because I think there is a definitive way to progress. Since crafting is unlocked via research, in order to obtain the next upgrade you must go explore islands. But between islands it's just the same thing - open ocean with useful trash drifting by you, occasionally the shark comes and is annoying. Additionally, dying didn't seem to matter to me, because after trying to avoid dying on my first life, I realized there is no punishment for it and promptly proceeded to throw myself off my raft repeatedly to gather materials to make a paddle so I could get my raft un-stuck (the reason I died was because my raft got caught against an island, and I couldn't safely collect the needed resources to free it or repair it without getting attacked by the shark). This is kind of lame, because it is a survival game so obviously you should want to survive.After getting metal and copper I lost motivation to continue because it seems like there's no end in sight for having to keep gathering these materials. The tools and weapons get destroyed pretty quickly from using them, and you still have to manually gather ores from the ocean floor around islands. There are ways to make this easier, and admittedly I did not craft flippers, air bottle, or shark bait, but the tedium would still be there because having to manually gather these materials means you can't be doing anything else. You can set up nets on your boat to automate gathering trash (planks, plastic, barrels, palm leaves), but nothing moves in the water - just your raft. So if your raft is anchored then pretty much nothing is happening on it (aside from cooking, smelting, crop growing). One major positive side of this is that the shark does not attack the raft while you are away from it.The islands are pre-generated layouts. After playing for 3 hours the 2 big islands I encountered were the exact same. I encountered a decent variety of mini islands but they were all pretty similar - they have a chest and plants. I think I would be a lot more motivated to explore if the islands felt more interesting. Between my first and second big island encounter, I crafted a bow and a bunch of arrows, getting ready to take down the rock throwing bird. But sadly there wasn't one on the island.In summary, I think the game is definitely lacking content and variety. Currently I don't want to replay with friends because I would spend my time doing the exact same things the entire time. That being said, if you like to try out different survival games then you would very likely enjoy this one.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 29 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI bought this game when it first came out. It game was way better when back then. If you are a solo player, this game is unbelievably hard on normal or higher difficulty at first, but once you get a start, its pretty easy.. too easy. You may have to start over 50 times before you get a start where you can start surviving. With a friend or 2 it is way easier but can also get pretty boring since it is the same thing over and over and over.... and over again.  The islands that you used to land on when the game came out pretty much had every resource on them.. now you will find islands without rocks even.... how can there be an island without a rock totally stupid developer idea.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesibought and played this game back at launch, when it was EA... The gameplay was pretty solid and looked like a fun game to enjoy... Except it's not that fun playing solo. But I thought hey, its EA, i'm sure they going to improve the game... 3 years later... It's still the same game. Still have the same video resolution issues (how didn't they fix this already by now? It's not normal that this is the only game around that doesn't autocorrect your video settings and you're unable to return if its the wrong settings)I'm a bit disappointed in this game. I had high hopes for it, but this totally fails my expectations. I'm sure this is a lot of fun playing with friends. I can imagine playing this with friends and it might be a challenge to survive.But for a singleplayer game, this survival game is just lacking. 3 years after launch, Still nothing in the beginning is explained, which i hoped it would have been by now. Like a small introduction? Airplane crash, Titanic sunk? Idk something? No basic tips on how to use your items. Go figure it out on your own. Shark attacks you already in the beginning, without any basic understanding of the game.

"Yayınlanma: 22 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiIt's a good game, quite unique actually. You need to keep collecting resources to advance, and find new locations. A blast with friends, but it's unfinished.Why the negative review:Last real content update was october 2020. Rather have the dev's finish the game and give us more chapters. Instead they give us more ""building blocks"" and ""customization"". It's fun to have a cool raft but it's worth nothing if you can't discover new locations. That's a let down imo.It's still worth it imo, even out of sale.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 18 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI must say that I do like this game. But the sad fact is that there are computers on which this game crashes, and (alas!) my one is in this category.From the very beginning the game behaved itself, it started to freeze and reboot my PC only after roughly 5 hrs of playing time. After that it took about half a year before the official game support reacted to my ticket at all. It took them another couple of months to send me email saying that they do know about this issue with some computers, but have no idea how to fix it (the best option I was given is to try and reinstall older version of my video card drivers). By that time I had about 15 hrs of play time (with 500 system crashes in between) and more than half a year since the game purchase. So obviously no refund for me here.And I guess because there are not too many complains like that, devs are happily working on other stuff, and prefer to ignore the bug. In fact, there were no bug fixes since the minor one in October 2020, so I guess they just prefer to ignore bugs in general.As a result despite liking the game and wanting to play it, I am super disappointed.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 15 Haziran 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game has the potential to be a good game, but the lousy survival mechanics honestly ruin it. The shark constantly destroys parts of your raft, which is supposed to be an ""interesting obstacle"" but just ends up being annoying. Furthermore, you're constantly interrupted by the food and water mechanic, which just ends up wasting your time. I swear, most of my game time is fishing and waiting for my food to cook or my water to boil. It's annoying! There are some games that get these mechanics to actually be fun and engaging, but this isn't one of them. You honestly can't do anything for 2 minutes before you need to spend 3 minutes refilling your bars, and then the shark will probably come along and destroy your grill or something.But the worst part of this waste of time is the bugs. Oh, the bugs! I don't care if its in early access, its been several years! I constantly get glitched into roofs, my tools break (not because of durability or any intended mechanic) my rods and hooks keep teleporting back into my hands, effectively softlocking me, and the animations are so incredibly sloppy its frankly incredible! When you eat a fish for example, you lift it back up after eating it, and then it just dissappears into the ether. Why would they have you lift it back up!?Maybe in like 5 years this game will come out of early access and wont stink of poorly implemented features and bugs, but for now its just a broken mess.

"Yayınlanma: 20 Mayıs 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiREVIEWED the vanilla version!I like this idea. Its like Minecraft-Skyblock, but as a boat on the vast emptiness of self constructing unlimited islands.Build your boat HUUUGE, make it majestic. Make it small, functional. Whatever you like.This game is Early Access as it should be. The idea is great, but there are a few things that really make the experience ""less fun"" which all vaguely can be described as ""too less content"":- no automated farming (or too less luxury meals) => therefore you have to plant every tomatoe, and cook every SINGLE tomatoe by hand, thats 2x ""E"" with some walking between your field and furniture for half a heart. You even have to water them, while needing water for yourself! You have to have to manage your hunger/drinking so much, its exhausting...This is cool in the early game, but when you got the biggest ship possible out there with like 3 chests full of wood, you kinda expect some kind of luxury (or progress). I dont want to waste 50% of my playtime just managing cooking and stuff when Im capable of rebuilding New York.- not that much content. You got your set of like 20 islands that appear randomly in the distance and like 10 story islands which do only exist once. Once you are through with every story island, you dont have anything left to do (except making the boat EVEN LARGER!)- the fighting and movement is very boring. Fighting a generic mob in melee is always the same:Press left-click.Wait for sword to swing.Move to target and wait for the damage.Move back.Repeat.Since you are the fastest, this is the ultimate way to kill every generic enemy.Fighting doesnt have to be good in this game. I´d rather have other improvements. Also the physics to control your boat are on the most basic level - but thats fine, because it´s what you expect.Do I recommend this game? Not yet. It is funny indeed (for a few hours), but for 20 bucks I´d rather play other games",N/A

Another thing is when you play with someone as you're the host the server can lag from the other player for some odd reason. I've scoured the entire internet for possible bug fixes for the black screen and 1. there's not many solutions, and 2. none of the solutions I have come across have actually worked.

"Yayınlanma: 12 Nisan 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiGame is a kind of neat, but even after a few hours of playing, I've crafted most of the tech tree.  There's also a lot of problems that really take you out of the immersion.1.  No tutorial at all, even for basic raft-unique things like...2.  Your broken 3 plank with nothing on it raft can float away while you're on an island.  Then, all sorts of problems happen because the raft itself is the center point of the game world.3.  Fall into the water accidently (happens frequently) while dragging an object with your hook?  That object ceases to exist.4.  Objects just sail under your raft instead of colliding with it.5.  Rocks?  Rarest resource to find, apparently, even on the islands.  Instead, you have to swim down, and hope to find some while seeing endless amounts of ores, clay and other resources that look like rocks...6.  Starve to death on the raft?  Everything you were carrying is gone, solely for the purpose of prolonging the game.7.  See those mangoes on the bush?  Can't harvest them without a stone axe, which you probably don't have because you have 20 ore and 1 stone (takes 3 to craft)...8.  Conversely, you don't even see coconuts on trees...9.  Lots of flowers and flower seeds.  Totally junk items.   Actually, about half of all items are purely decorative.10.  I had to look up almost everything.   Like, I built a water purifier and a cup.  But it didn't appear to do anything. It turns out, it had purified the saltwater I put into it, put it back into the spot I put the salt water, and now it's freshwater I then put back into my cup and drink...  Just very non-intuitive for a lot of things that seem very simple, but is easy to ""miss.""Overall, with the current content, it's a $5 game.

"Yayınlanma: 28 Mart 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiI have had an on and off relationship with this game for years. I have had positive. and negeative reviews on my account before, and through playing this game for so long has helped me realize, do not buy this game. raft has one of the strongest game concepts I have ever seen, and its one that I have wanted for years, but the execution is very poor. Alike all the other games these have developers create, they are too focused on adding new content to explore than to overhaul their games. In early gameplay of this game, I enjoyed it very much. Credit where credit is due, the raft gameplay is excellent, but the issue this game runs into is that the majority of the gameplay takes place on land. As soon as you jump into the water near islands, the shark will freak, and the hitboxes become broken and unfiar. The shark can phase into walls to sneak attack you. Other times, the shark will bite you, and it will not register as a hit, or the other way around. This is not exclusive to underwater, either. On certian islands, there are enemies to fight, and the same issues arise. On top of this, you have to very regularly eat and drink. Although helps gameplay on the raft. having to carry large amounts of food and water with you into islands is oddly frustrating. Even just walking on land feels clunky, and it becomes hard to enjoy when its filled to the brim with bugs, especially in multiplayer. This game is grindy and honestly becomes hard to enjoy after the first fun gameplay loop of raft and small islands. 3/10, this game is a time waster at its finest, I legitimatley have more fun ignoring the storyline.

Never found a big island because the radio / receiver placement requirements on the raft are absolutely stupid.  Even the crafting requirements seem too costly.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Şubat 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis is fairly good survival game, definitely enjoyable at times but the developers are absolute cavemen with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ death system they have in this game. If you play on some of the lower difficulties there are zero penalties for death, not very good for most survival games. Okay but there is Normal right, whats wrong with that? Well unfortunately wanting a bit more challenge turns out to be a stupidly high difficulty spike as Devs decided that if you die in any difficulty besides Easy, you have to lose your entire inventory and it is irretrievable. Unlike 90% of survival games you can't retrieve your items either, have back-up saves? Too bad, your character and world are on different files.

The second packs in features, then leaves the balance for later.Unfortunately, this is the later, and while there are plenty of awesome mechanics and ideas here, the balance from the get go is all out of wack, with the sharks coming basically on a toe in water, and the player requiring more food than a 1%er at a dinner party, not to mention the lack of items being dropped on death (is this not a basic of survival games?)I understand what early access means, and I sincerely hope the balance can be fixed so I can properly enjoy the mechanics, but unfortunately that time is not now, and I cannot recommend it.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 19 Şubat 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiPlaying this game with friends is likely a good time. Unfortunately, solo rafting is only fun only up to the point where the game starts to spawn more and more things to kill you (bears, birds, giant rats, robots, etc.). This is primarily because there is no save mechanic (backing up the world does NOT save you from death) so dying (or being incapacitated as the game puts it) means you loose all the loot and gear you happen to be carrying. And since this is a crafting game, you'll save up your materials and outfit yourself with the best gear when you undertake a dangerous mission which means you will have just lost all your best stuff (and the raw materials that went into them) which I find more needlessly frustrating than good-ol'-fashioned challenging. If you have multiple people, then the good gear can be evenly distributed as can loot and an incapacitated player can be revived by team mates. If you're solo, you're screwed unless you want to respawn back at your bed WITHOUT your loot. Said loot also disappears so you're left crafting your stuff again assuming you have the raw resources; which in an of themselves are fairly easy to come across, but it is too time consuming in my opinion.Being able to make your way back to your corpse and get your loot back (7 Days to Die style) would go a long way in helping out solo players. Otherwise, this is just another attempt at forced socialization of the gaming population that doesn't already play...Left 4 Dead7 Days to DieFortniteOverwatchDestinyTabletop SimulatorSea of ThievesMinecraftRocket LeageAny VR game...and on and on and on...",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Şubat 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThought this might have been a fun little game to play. It wasn't. It should be called 'Hook Throwing Simulator'. Literally all I did was throw a hook around, build something, shark destroyed it, build it again, shark destroyed it again, drink water and eat food every 5 minutes. Could feel the massive grind that was just beginning and stopped. This game could easily be improved just by reducing the rate at which you need to consume sustenance to something reasonable, but as it is right now you literally need to be cooking food and making water 24/7. Not because they take so long to make, but because what you do make does almost nothing, and your thirst and hunger bars deplete REALLY fast.In short, game was super boring within the first 10 minutes and there are honestly way better games out there. Subnautica for one.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 7 Şubat 2021Ürün ücretsiz alındıWritten after full release:The game's exploration, progression and story is pretty solid but it has some ""massive"" issues:The game's Survival aspects are not exciting or fun in my opinion. The combat gets a bit janky at times and the frequent requirement of eating in order to keep your character's food and thirst bars up gets very tedious very fast. (you seriously have to eat and drink in every couple of minutes)The game's base building is fun, but gathering resources feels boring, repetitive and all around tedious. Getting the resources to make your Raft big already takes a while which is not helped by the fact that the bigger your boat is the more resources it takes to keep it moving.If I would've known the game has these issues I wouldn't have bought it.If you really want to get the game then I recommend you to wait for it to go on sale.Summary: MOST of the game's core mechanics are very tedious and repetitive which drains out a part of the enjoyment for the whole game (including the good parts).

"Yayınlanma: 4 Şubat 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game could be fun. But in many aspects of the game mechanics, the game rather just tries to annoy me and let me consume time as long as possible. I feel like drinking a watery soup.Take the amount of items required for making early tech path for example. They designed the smelter to need 5 dry bricks (in current version). And its processing capability is too small, thus you need 2 smelters. Then you need 11 sands and 11 clays plus several additional items for raft crafting etc. All for these materials you need to put a bait into water, wait a minutes watching your smartphone to see the shark dance, immediately jump into the sea gathering sands and clays, and rinse and repeat for about 4 to 5 times over three or more islands. It is not fun, just too repetitive and boring. Then do the same for minerals, coppers, sea weeds.Making something tedious is not making challenge. Challenge is fun, but tediousness isn't. I want to plan, decide, and some reflex in the game, not repeating some defined sequence several times. Same can be said to several landmark level design (for example, jumping between footholds inRadio Toweris apparently dull). Why I need three antennae? Oh do I need to repeat the same again? And did you count how many goos are required mid-game?Misc:Some parts of the game are apparently unbalanced (note this review is written during EA). For a cooking pot, you can cook four potato, with a hunger value of +40 in total, into a vegetable stew giving a hunger of +20 and an infinitesimal hunger bonus, plus consuming your precious 1/2 clay. Great.Tech progress is linear, and many items are not worth upgrading. Many early game resources are equally tedious to obtain in mid or late game.Receiver error message is very confusing. I spent literally hours on this.Japanese translation was not of a good quality, and was often misleading (I think this is because the translator doesn't know how these words are actually used in game; for example ""Water seeds"" was translated as if ""seeds enchanted with water element"").",N/A

The problem with having your item progression tied to story is that by the time you finish the story you don't have any urge to explore any more.  The railroaded experience of the story is the opposite of what they should of focused on in this game.  The wandering / exploration is what was good about this game but they engineered the feeling of wandering/discovery out by putting you on tracks.,N/A

Until that point in time, I will leave this here. This game is GARBAGE if you're playing it solo. The thirst and hunger meter drop so fast that you have little time to do anything before dying becomes a problem. This makes it so you have to focus on those two meters right away, or you're going to have a bad time. Want to stop by an island? Well too bad! You're going to need an anchor to do that, but you're almost dead of hunger and thirst so you have to build a grill and water purifier before you even think of making that anchor! Why do the meters drop so damn fast? It feels like your character needs 10 gallons of water and an entire banquet of food every hour or else they'll just drop dead.

"Yayınlanma: 26 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesitl;dr Not so great now. Might be cool in ~2 years.Raft is actually early access, this is NOT a Fatorio situation.Raft has a lot of potential. I've played for ~35 hours getting to where the 'mid/late game' content starts to show up and the game falls flat in a lot of ways.The key mechanism to survival games (Rust, DS/DST, etc) is the learning loop. Where you feel clever for figuring things out and the game rewards you for the iterative progress. And while you're on the ocean, that's absolutely the case. But the game pushes you to explore larger and larger islands which wind up requiring more and more resources while at the same time starting to feel less and less developed.  Quests feel awkward and it's difficult to engage in a narrative you never cared existed.I'll give you a heads up Raft developers, I'm in this game cause I like ocean. That was your pitch (as much as it is for Sea of Thieves).  You don't need to incentivize me to live in my Waterworld-esque stronghold, I already want to be there to escape my dead end job.But I hear you cry: ""There are mods!""The Raft Modules are easily the sketchiest thing I've seen in some time.

And worst it got some strange design decisions that should had be fixed through playtesting. Basically, the main issue that got me to quite the game is that everything require resources and time. In most games of this type this is fine and the main reason to play. However, in this game resources are spawn randomly. You get over time more reliable means to get what you want, however to get those you need to prey for RNGesus to give you what you want. There's no strategy, it's all about luck and waiting.

"Yayınlanma: 12 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game is called Raft, and the part of the game that takes place on the raft is actually pretty good.But once you go off the raft, there's issues. You need to hold down shift to sprint, and there's no disadvantage to doing so, so why strain my pinky finger like that? Just give us auto run. Off the raft there's no way to sleep, so you end up fumbling around in the dark. Off the raft what you need to do is a silly minigame where you fetch item A to unlock door B and so on.Subnauctica is a similar game. In subnauctica the dry parts of the game are mercifully short, as well as being well lit and free of particularly strong enemies. Raft puts all its strongest monsters on dry land, and as a result it overstays its welcome.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 17 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiNot the worst game i've ever played... but not much fun either. Game difficulty is based on clunkiness and poorly thought out design choices. I was holding off on leaving a bad review until after i saw where the game was headed but now they've released new content and nothing else changed so i guess its open season.Let me begin by saying survival crafting is by far my favorite genre. So please back off with the ""YoU jUsT dOnT LiKe SuRvIvAl""Premise is very fun, float around collect trash to build your raft. Raft doesn't have a way of steering for quite a while but you get over that since you're not really trying to get to a specific place. Fun with friends, if you don't have friends to play with then seriously stop reading this review and buy something else. Its straight boring af alone.Things that i hate-Right off rip there is little to no customization when it comes to starting a world. Choices are, lose stuff when die or not. And Food/water draining unrealistically fast or super unrealistically fast. Cant set what you start with, where you start, durability of items. Developer says no way, you think just because you paid for the game, you get to play it the way you want?!?! IKR how unreasonable of me...-Everything you pickup goes to your hot bar instead of inventory. Eventually your hot bar is full of tools but for hours you must constantly move random crap from hot bar to inventory. Few updates and this hasnt changed.... Nobody will get me to agree that this is a good decision... its laziness.-Tools break so fast that crafting good tools is a complete waste of time. Why dive down and get bit by the shark 2194 times just to get enough material for a metal hook that is hardly better than the one you can make with scraps off the top of the water. Item durability is in place to make the game harder.... i guess... just makes it more boring and tedious. I mean the screens on the store page for this game... even the developers didn't bother making a metal hook LMAO. Even they know how much of a stupid waste of time it is.-Hit boxes are awful. Nothing more to say on that, they're terribly sloppy.-When you are able to kinda steer the raft, first thing you want to do is visit and exciting island... except there aren't any. Just the same few empty, lifeless, boring AF land masses... with nothing interesting on them. Except trees... need lots of wood... you would think trees would be the answer, but no. Cut down every tree on the island for like 12 planks.... this has got to be a joke. Someone was laughing their a$$ off ""OK get this you know how players need tons of wood...lets make full trees give 6 planks!!!"". Stupid-Wooden spear is the most worthless thing you can make, don't bother with it. More effective to just replace pieces of your boat until you have a metal one. Even then, don't use the metal one... you'll break it ffs... stupid-The amount of food and water needed to ""survive"" is just ridiculous. I'm pretty sure if you ate 37 fish in a day you wouldn't be STARVING by that night. But here again its easier for crappy systems to dictate difficulty rather than adding things to a game?-The shark is just annoying. Not at all scary... ANNOYING. Easy to avoid, easy to get away from... just annoying. Kill it? Respawns immediately and back to being annoying. Give me 15 minutes or something...or how about this?!?! LET ME DECIDE HOW OFTEN I WANT THE SHARK TO RESPAWN. I know its a new idea, making a game that can be customized to be played how ever the player wants. Almost all survival games are deeply CUSTOMIZABLE... yea its a word steam... as of 2012. Classic valve.-I love grindy games, i play them all the time... because the rewards make the grind worth it. The reward for grinding in this game is the chance to do more grinding...In closing, all the bad about this game could be fixed in one fell swoop of a patch, but the developer says ""NO YOU MUST PLAY HOW I SAY!!!""Bought this for my 7yo daughter to play with her... it's too boring for a 7yo girl even! Every once in a while i drag her back into it like tonight... which resulted in me leaving this review finally.PLEASE ADD CUSTOMIZATION. Why is there a mod to allow respawn of gear with a button press in normal mode?!?! LMFAO because people want it and you're too lazy to add it. FIX the little janky quirks like pickup to hot bar.",N/A

Claim the bugs will be fixed shortly even though 4-year-old bugs still remain in the game6. ""The Renovation Update was substantial!""7. Dip out after several years of defending the length of time to make just this one updateThe quality of the new update is... fine. The new blueprints are no-brainers that improve the game's quality of life considerably, although there are a few that are clearly missing. We have an electric juicer but not an electric cooking pot, the titanium tools are just incremental upgrades and aren't permanent as though smacking a space-age metal alloy through arecaceae or picking up a pile of sand from a beach would damage it in any significant way, there are two puzzles revolving around electric wiring but you still can't wire your raft and have to run around replacing car batteries for some reason, and you are incapable of growing berries, chilis, or turmeric and have to rely on divine providence for them to generate in a merchant's shop.The story changed from being about an ecological disaster (obviously, right?) to more of a small-scale warlord thing. I wouldn't exactly call this a spoiler because it's not even clear there's really a ""plot"" per se until the last half of the last island. Plug in a number to your receiver, go to an island, get off your raft, listen to some audio logs about people doing essentially the same thing, press E until you find another number, plug it into your receiver, rinse repeat. Myst, which this game is trying very hard at intervals to emulate on all these ""story islands,"" had a much more coherent narrative in a considerably shorter game almost 30 years ago with a smaller development team.Overall, the development of Raft has been more of a bus ride than a roller coaster. As time went on it became very clear that the developers were mentally checked out of working on it anymore and I think this realization occurred to me around early 2021. The pace of development decelerated and ultimately it doesn't feel like this is a game that required almost TWO YEARS between story chapters to complete. I'm at least half sure that if you buy this game now without knowing anything about it, it will still feel like it's in early access. Hence, not recommended.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game is fun to play with others but there are a couple of issuses that make it not such a great experience. At the beginning, you constantly lack resources. Later on, you still lack certain resources while others keep overflowing. This is basically because some resources are found frequently but not needed much (e.g. clams or clay).There are a few more issues, e.g. the way thing spawn around you only if you are moving (because the sea is not actually moving anything). I got stuck on islands twice because of this. It is quite annoying that animals get respawn if you walk away a few steps. Maybe this should only happen when a new day starts. I am not sure what the heavy current shaking the raft is supposed to add to the game. It is annoying to keep 'drowning' on your raft, especially as this cancels certain actions and makes building close to impossible. But you do not get washed off your raft and your raft cannot take damage so it's not dangerous, it's just annoying. There is missing a notification when your inventory is full. You just drop stuff. The game even tells you that you collected something while you didn't actually do so. I am also missing a little context for the game. Why are we on a raft? Why is there no one else? Are we trying to find a way back to civilisation or do we stay on the raft forever? The game feels aimless without a purpose.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiRewriting my review because it is SO much worse than I thought it wasThe pros:  It's a really fun team game to play with friends, and the more people you have the less glaring the flaws areThe cons:  Where do I even begin?  It's so horrifically unbalanced and buggy. Let's talk about the save file system.  When you die, it corrupts ALL of your save files.  Save and try to experiment because you're new to the game and need to explore mechanics before you ♥♥♥♥ something up?  Well you better quit the game before you die because if it autosaves a death, it corrupts ALL your save files so they all load with you dying.  If you need to be told forcing people to alt-f4 their game so they don't lose their save files is bad design you have no business making video games.  What they call ""backups"" only serve to give you a false sense that you can experiment within the game, this is the biggest ♥♥♥♥ you the developers could have done to anyone who wants to learn or play this game.  It's basically a roguelike but unlike actual roguelikes where the challenge is in the game itself, in this game it's purely the RNG that ♥♥♥♥♥ you over.  You can't just jump into this game, you literally have to know the exact build order of everything, which completely takes away all player agency.  I can't decide if I want a fishing pole or a sail, you WILL die without the fishing pole ASAP and it takes a ton of rope.  As yet I haven't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ an island to spawn with rocks so I can make an axe within the first two islands on single player, and have wasted 3 hours now starting new games just trying to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ axe on the first island so I can have more food and palm leaves.  You don't find enough food to keep you going past the first island, you MUST have a fishing rod AND grill by the first island.  If you could make the axe that wouldn't be a problem but again, it's purely the RNG that ♥♥♥♥♥ you over.  This is just beyond awful balance, to the point where I would not consider this playable on single player at the moment.  Furthermore, player scaling is completely whack.  1 player is pure luck whether it's possible at all, 2 players seems fairly well balanced, 3 players becomes trivially easy.  Difficulty should not scale that starkly with player count, and possibility of actually playing the game scaling with player count AT ALL is absolutely unacceptable.  Stay well away from this until the devs actually playtest their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 5 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiPromising game, but:- The UI is way too clunky. I was not able to figure out how to use research table or planting pod, couldn't be bothered to search online for such basic stuff;- Inventory space is limited and inventory management is cumbersome;- Survival is too intense and adding clunky inventory mechanics to that, gets really unfun really quickly: do I really need to select the cup, fill it with salt water, put onto the purifier, [do something else], forget that you need to re-select the cup in order to get a drink, select cup again, fill with fresh water, click drink, just to have a drink?- The tools get used up quickly and the management chaos intensifies even more;- The shark is extremely annoying. I get it, there needs to be a sense of danger, but I feel the shark mechanic could be handled better... if you want to have some relief you have to produce shark bait, add it to the list of all the cumbersome tasks you need to do, and you find out is was not much relief after all;- 3 times in the 1.5 hours I played I had a bug where I dived and resurfaced to find out everything around me was gone;All in all, I feel the above flaws are fixable.

"Yayınlanma: 2 Ocak 2021Erken Erişim İncelemesiUpon purchasing and launching the game, I immediately noticed that there was a problem with the launch menu running at low FPS.

"Yayınlanma: 31 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiWhether it's intentional or not, the hook gathering mechanic is janky.  It's not challenging or fun or skill based, it's just bad.  Most of the time spent in early game is missing half your throws or waiting for random garbage to pass close enough to gather without the hook.  The cost of crafting makes you spend long amounts of time doing this, even on easy.  Barrels are few and far between and almost never have the one thing you need.  It seems like there's a good game once you get going, but getting to that point may not be worth it.  By this time in other survival/craft games I was already off and running and eager to gather/craft the next big thing.  Raft doesn't deliver this same feeling in a timely manner.",N/A

I was under the water and the bird NAILED me perfectly, killing me. Although this game does have good things about it, the short story probably is the reason why they make everything deteriorate so fast. after all the fights.. the boss fight wasnt that great and we killed the alpha pretty quick. then all of sudden there was all these people and then we ask ""now what?"".. not much to do besides float around and build a raft.. figured there would be alot more to do in this game but oh well.

"Yayınlanma: 21 Aralık 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiEARLY ACCESS (FIRST IMPRESSIONS ONLY)GAMEPLAY SYNOPSISRaft is a new popular early access game in which the player tries to survive on a raft in the middle of an ocean, having to battle hunger, thirst and an angry shark while trying to find out what happened to the world and where everybody is.DIFFICULTYYou just grind for a long time, then you lose everything because this game is annoying to solo because it is heavily multi-player focused. And I have no friends. You spend a decent amount of time getting some tools, expand your raft some, and then BAM your hungry.

It is extremely hard right when you start, especially if you don't know what to do.  But becomes exponentially easier as you learn and tech up.  It just didn't provide much of a challenge for me and there is NOTHING endgame to keep you interested in continuing on.  Since I already have it I'll put it back on the shelf until I see they have added another chapter and then I'll probably start fresh and beat the game again in less than 10 hours even with the new content.

Constantly killed over this bs and lose ""2/3"" of my loot. VERY slow and repetitive, story is completely boring and adds nothing to the game. Collect, kill shark and bird, die, rinse repeat. All of this just blocks out what a good game it could be. There's no wonder or adventure to this game. But it instead feels like a tumor is growing in my brain because devs rather make a quick buck now days then spend actual time. at least 3 years and it still feels like it's in early access because they decided decoration was more important then game play.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 17 Kasım 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiJust bought the game, played it for 15 min, Tho steam shows one hour. Really wanted to play this; looks great. Seen alot of people enjoying it. I couldn't get past the main menu. the dropped frames were absolutely killing me. I would go from 160 to 1 and the entire screen would lock up for a split second the rocket back to 100+. Sadly I guess i won't be able to give this game a real try.Edit:Ok I wanted to update this review because I feel its important to leave honest feed back. I'm not sure if its the team behind Raft, or if its the graphical updates and changes but things on the game are running significantly smoother. The screen lockups have been resolved and the game is running well at this point. I've only just started so I've got about an hour into the game but it is beautiful. I enjoy the concept and as long as these changes stay consistent then I'll be changing my recommendation to a yes.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Kasım 2020Simple and fun game, but unfortunately it has too much grind and very little content, and how I wish it was the other way around.It is entertaining experience for pretty much anyone and can be played alone or with other people. Unfortunately as much, it does not have much to offer in terms of content, as everything is hidden behind constant need of focusing on keeping your character alive, by drinking and eating a LOT (like, seriously, A LOT), which is going to probably keep you busy for like 50% of the time you play this game. And another 40% is gathering materials for tools or expanding your raft.Not only you need to refill character's needs by eating horrendous amounts of food/drink, you also need to do so very often. The only way to make this ""less"" of a chore, you need to start making ""advanced"" food, which is made by using recipes - takes forever to make and even that is for a SINGLE portion, and in the process, you make empty bowls/glasses and fill them with the prepared content. While consuming them, you also consume the bowl/glass, further expanding the need to grind for clay and sand respectively (and no, you cant just dig up sand on beach).Customizing the raft is probably the best feature, a mobile home to travel and explore places. But in order to do so, CHORES....again. Expanding and improving the raft takes a lot of resources, but probably the best part about it is the fact, that those things such as raft modifications and decorations are permanent (excluding structures damaged by shark (boi oh boi I will rant about the shark later in the review) andthe need to refuel engines) unlike majority of items in this game that breaks after few minutes of usage. But like, for real. As I mentioned the grind before, all the tools have very limited durability with no option to repair them, only being able to make new ones. Combine this and the need to eat/drink so much and it makes up for majority of what this game has to offer.The last 10% is exploration. And I am serious, not even kidding. The main....campaign is rather short and could be finished very quickly, if getting to story-specific locations would be faster (the only limitation is how much food/water do you currently have and by how fast your raft moves, but if we excluded these factors, finishing the game's story mode would be relatively fast). Other than story-based locations, it does have some generic islands with points of interests that yields resources, has a trade outpost and an animal or two...which is used to produce resources for you, but killing it yields absolutely nothing (yea thanks devs...). And after you finish the storyyou get access to create the ""endgame"" tier of tools. Literally at the end of the game. When there is absolutely NOTHING ELSE TO DO other than completing Steam achievements such as killing 50 angry-long-range bird bombers equipped with HESR Shells (High Explosive Shrapnel Rock) that will constantly hit you even if you are out of its blast radius.SHARK.One word, so much frustration. Another game that makes sharks into ""baddies"", in the worst way possible.Story-wise, the Antarctica has melted or something and entire world is under the seaand this absolute laser-guided heat-seeking Shark-torpedo is always there, just for you. There are dolphins swimming around. There are manta rays swimming around. THERE ARE HUGE FISH LIKE SALMONS AND CATFISH IN THE OCEAN. BUT THE SHARK DOESN'T CARE. YOU. ARE. ITS. ONLY. DIET. (or bait that you make out of other smaller fish.....) This annoying creature is there to ruin your day in every way possible. Want to get on an island? Too bad, you gonna get your backside bitten. Want to dive in for some resources, get ready to loose your arm out of nowhere. Just fallen out of your raft for 0.1 second into the water? Don't worry! The shark got you! (literally). It also loves wood. Like, for real, it eats your ship. It loves to eat everything you make or carry about. But it wont eat random wood that floats around....pff, why would it, right?Annoying eh? BUT WAIT, THERES MORE!You can ultimately ends its existence....yess. And eat it too! Yummy! But in few next brief minutes after you eat your favorite shark Terry, you will be greeted by his brother Garry. And after you finish Garry, Harry will come say hi instead. And this cycle goes on forever until the end of times. Fun.Reason I have played this game so much is: I played it before its final update came out and wanted to give it another go, before revising my old review. And really, not much has changed, other than giving the game some more painting options and some minor quality-of-life changes such as makingbiofuelso much better and finishing the story-mode. Other than that, It does not offer much replayability or reason to stay longer. (You can go for the Steam achievements, but after completing them, you might need an appointment with psychiatrist to check on your mental health).",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 16 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiCould have been nice but everything is artificially stretched to disguise how empty and lifeless the world is. Everything takes ages and you spend hours drifting/running through emptiness. There is no real challenge, it's just very tedious. All crafting is ridiculously overpriced while gear is consumed super fast. There is very little to nothing you can do to speed things up or automate them. The story feels very slapped on. Fighting is absolutely stupid too. Animals just teleport themselves or dash at you, making it impossible to dodge them. Missing or hitting is purely luck.The resource ""planks"" is needed for basically everything: cooking, crafting and as fuel. Of course the amount of planks needed grows rapidly, especially with the ""overpriced"" crafting recipes. At some point we unlocked ""plant plots"" which allow you to plant the seeds you got from exploring the otherwise empty islands that pop-up from time to time. Great, we thought, let's make a few of these and our wood supply is finally covered. But no, not only do the trees take ages to grow, all the trees (palm, mango, birch) on average return less than one seed. That means you still have to jump on otherwise useless and boring and islands if you want to keep up your planks production. Of course there are also a few in the ocean but even with the overly expensive collector nets this barely covers the demands. It just overall feels very unbalanced and slow. Seems like just another attempt to artificially stretch the playtime. In any other survival craft (take Terraria, Dont Starve) essential resources like wood are at some point self-perpetuating (which they should be), but no, not this game.If you want to play this game, play it on easy so you don't lose EVERYTHING on a stupid death (of course you can also try to convince a friend to carry you over the whole island for 10 minutes while being chased by bears, but who does that..)  and be very, VERY, patient.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 13 Ekim 2020There has never been a game that made me more angry and annoyed than this oneI always try to make positive Steam reviews because every game has lots of effort behind it, but this one is so incredibly bad and overrated that it hurtsFor this one I just have to write out this stuff somewhere, no matter if anyone will ever read this and what they will think about my reviewRaft started out photorealistic many years ago, then switched developers to some student group that took 4 years to add stuff to their game which sold incredibly well. I don't think the concept is theirs, but I am not sureIt's not an ""epic adventure"", just an endless list of annoying things piling up, it's like a sidequest, but as a full gameThe fighting system has not been touched for 3 years now, it's impossible to know the range of your weapon.On normal settings, you have maybe 30 seconds to do anything before needing to drink, eat, or stab a shark or bird multiple times. The bird and shark almost certainly will at least damage your crops or raft once before you can kill them. It's supposed to keep you on your feet, but becomes more and more annoying. You can craft things to keep them away, but this is further into the game.To gather ANY resources at an island, you first have to spend MINUTES fishing for some bait, which stops the shark for maybe one minute. At the pace at which you can swim and gather resources, this is basically nothing. Bait has been eaten? Whoops, shark is coming for you, be quick out of the water! It's simply annoying---- ""Exploration"" -----The islands in general are okay, not really interesting to explore anything. For a game that LIVES OFF EXPLORATION, there is almost nothing to explore.The stations you have to find using the radar are of course all different, but if you go inside they're all as copy-paste as possible. The plantation was my ""favorite"": ~4 skyscrapers to ""explore"", of which every hotel room was just like the previous. Or, an island with radio towers. But every tower was like the previous, all trees the same, nothing to see. A cave here and there, with some dirt in it. Maybe this makes sense story-wise, but it's just stupid to make an exploration-based game full of water, where when you discover something not-water, you've seen everything there is to see after 1 minute of running aroundRunning around is also one thing. It's just not fun to get sent from one point to the other, backtrack X times, just to gather 1 item to unlock some room, from which you're sent yet to another, etc etc. It's all, one, huge, sidequest.Add to that the enemies-- EnemiesThe first times I played with unprovoked enemy hostility enabled. And it's very fun to die to one bear 100 times, run up the whole island for 2 minutes again, just to get a couple hits and repeat the same process. Or, spend 10 minutes running around gathering fruits to distract the bear for some short amount of time, so you can get a couple more of the ~30 hits you're supposed to land. How fun!Or, want to loot an island? No chance, there's a bird that will hit you every time with a stone. Want to hit it? Tough lock, it's near impossible. Want to find its nest? Well, it changes its landing places so you're always at the wrong spot. I've even played this with a friend, and we both died so many times we just quit.Or the great behaviour of the ""rhino-shark"", and so on.Eventually, I played on friendly...Raft tries to have exploration, fighting, puzzle games, jump and runs, survival. It just does nothing of that well... I have followed this game's process for many years now and they not once improved any of the problems.

"Yayınlanma: 13 Ekim 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiSynopsis: The game feels shallow, unpolished, and limited by design choices.The basic premise is you, a raft, and a shark. You drift along, collect debris from the water to expand and repair your raft, optionally use a spear or bait to deter the shark from eating you or your raft, and optionally keep yourself alive by drinking water and eating food. If you die, you lose your carried inventory and respawn on your raft. If the shark eats enough of your raft you lose the game. That is it for required gameplay. There is no option to build a new raft if you lose yours, and you cannot build anywhere other than your raft. There is no character progression. Tech ""research"" consists of simply sacrificing one of every component in the game to the research table. The game just lacks depth and replayability, and what difficulty can be found is tied too much to the passing of time rather than gameplay elements.I realize from my short time playing that this is not my type of survival game. However, I really don't understand how it is so appealing to such a broad audience.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 20 Eylül 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI underestimated how annoying gameplay would be.None of the (early?) challenges were very hard, just constant bothersome chores:- hurry to fish cause you're starving.- hurry to purify water before you get thirsty.- hurry to repel the wood-eating shark before it breaks your raft (except before crafting a spear, then you just stare helplessly as it does whatever it wants).- navigation is such a pain that just describing it is a pain (just read any of the gameplay basics guides if you don't believe me).- durability is terrible, tools break after a day or two.Some basic actions you'll perform many times require holding key/button (instead of toggle); a hallmark of annoying UIs.Basic raw materials are automatically put in your toolbar so when you craft/get something useful you have to go look for it in the general inventory since your bar will be full. Oh, and moving stuff from the inventory is via drag-and-drop, not a fast method. And you can't use stuff directly from the inventory.When choosing what to craft the game doesn't pause, penalizing early learning. As in, learning what your character can do will make early game harder as the time spend investigating will make you thirsty, hungry, and maybe not recognize the sound of the shark eating your (delicious?) raft.Honestly, it's all just rushing from one manual chore to the next.

Those bugs make me wanna stop playing the game...Or for example, when you're dead, your hunger and thirst keeps going down which is not logic...Also, there is no maps on the big islands, and it's difficult to play multi without knowing where you are, mainly when one  is dead and you try do find him to take him back on the boat but you end up dead, killed the way I described before by animals.

The first personal view is horrible, fighting in this game is horrible because the enemies strike you twice more than you strike them, in the final island you have some puzzle with not a lot of enemies (which is really nice) but thoses puzzles are horrible because you need to use ctrl + shift + space at the same time, but the functionalities of those cases are BUGGED, your character can eat 50 banana in a row, you'll be hungry 5 minutes after...

"Yayınlanma: 5 Temmuz 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiUnfortunately, with the default wide screen mode important items like Raft Anchor are not available.  Right out the gate I had players getting mad because I couldn't access critical menu items, the only way to fix is to use 1080 which looks bad and doesn't give you the full widescreen experience.  There should be a simple config file fix to adjust or an option in the GUI.  I can't give this good marks until the game works out of box.  Other then that it looks ok and an enjoyable family game.  Also when I first opened the game it came up in Ultra wide which I thought would be enjoyable but its not since you can play the game correctly in this mode missing critical items you need to build to survive.  Please fix this, I see two years of users complaining about this problem online.  Should be fixed at this time, native controller support would also be nice.

"Yayınlanma: 2 Temmuz 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiOkay it be a good game but really the only problem I have is the lack of a way to get your items after you die, Minecraft has it so frankly it surprised me and admittedly pissed me off that I couldn't at least get some of my items back.So I deleted the world and uninstalled cause I really couldn't be bothered to get 2 hours worth of progress back, yeah it's probably irrational anger but when you play solo and have no way to get items back after death it just ruined the experience for me.Plus knowing that if I make one false mistake would mean I'd lose all my inventory just put me off wanting to try again. I really cannot recommend this game in it's current state but hopefully they might fix this issue cause it seems really dumb not having such a simple feature for people who like to play solo.Update: I dunno why but I revisited this game and yeah it's still annoying and has now added a pig enemy that once alerted to your presence will keep attacking you no matter what and is irritating to fight due to it taking any minor damage you can deal.They still haven't added a way to track where you last died so you STILL cannot get any of your inventory back when you have died so solo play is still highly irritating to deal with.So I still in the games current state cannot recommend it and it's frankly really disappointing to say that.(Also wouldn't recommend this even on sale)",N/A

For me I was getting motion sick after less than 2 hours game play.Note to developers.... please make a setting for calm oceans, so, others like myself can still play.I understand a desire for ""realism"" so, for those that say ""calm oceans"" ruins the game, may I point out the quantity and type of resources floating near your raft isn't realistic. We just need a little suspension of disbelief. That is part of any game. Just asking for an option to make it calm.3) some kind of information on using/deploying what you build. maybe something that can set set to brief description or even off for more experienced players4) I get 2 blueprints, receiver and antenna. after building research bench I could place them in, but, nothing changed.If these concerns were addressed I would change to recommend to play.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Haziran 2020TL;DR: Раст для бедных, глючный и скучныйUPD: удаление невидимых объектов в игре отсутствует, поэтому последняя часть кампании становится просто непроходимой из-за тормозовИтак, после трёх с половиной часов игры я захотел рефанд. Почему? В самом начале заняться в игре особенно нечем. Старт, прямо скажем, тяжёлый, потому что начинаете вы на плоту из четырёх тайлов, ничего не понятно, а акула настойчиво отгрызает последние пальцы. Но рефанд мне не дали, поэтому пришлось ещё немного поиграть, чтобы жаба не душила.После того, как я добавил немного жилплощади и поставил парус, меня прибило к моему первому острову с тремя пальмами, арбузами, ананасами и цветами. Я собрал, всё, что видел и поплыл ко второму острову. Пока я по нему бродил, случилось невероятное: ветер повернул в другую сторону, мой плот самовольно отчалил и уплыл за горизонт, потому что якорь крафить я не научился. И знаете что? Я решил, что построю новый плот. А он не строится. Упс. Пока я бегал и пытался поставить основание, плот вывалился за край карты и произошёл деспаун локации. Пришлось начинать заново.Во второй раз я просто помер с голоду, потому что арбузы - это не еда, а удочки у меня ещё не было. На третью попытку я не выдержал и снизил сложность с максимума до минимума, после чего наконец начал въезжать. Кое-как отстроившись, я начал искать способы решить проблему акулы на корню. Убивать её, к слову, бесполезно, потому что она мгновенно респаунится обратно. Первый способ, который пришёл в голову - укрепление дна железом. И, как мне показалось, это работало, акула больше не кусалась за укреплённые тайлы. Но в начале игры это довольно дорого. И тут мне стукнуло в голову, что, наверное, она не сможет укусить тайл, если я поставлю на него бортик. Ага, как бы не так! Эта сцуко укусила тайл СКВОЗЬ бортик. Ну, ладно, я плюнул и решил вернуться к первому методу, но с уточнением, что укреплять я буду только крайние тайлы: не будет же она кусать внутренние. Как я ошибался... Эта зараза сожрала тайл, на котором у меня стояла антена и всё, что там было, развалилось.И таких приколов в игре более, чем достаточно.Ранние этапы игры довольно скучные: плаваешь от одного клочка земли к другому, строишься... и всё. Ещё и фиг допрёшь, как исследовать чертежи: я пытался пихать их на рабочий стол, а нужно туда пихать компоненты и только тогда будут открываться новые исследования. А чертежи можно выкидывать. Самое интересное начинается с постройки радиостанции: тут и сюжетка кое-как развивается, и появляются новые варианты крафта, и вообще.Графоний в игре не весть что, но сойдёт. Вода и волны довольно правдоподобные, а остальное, будто из халявных ассетов собрано.Музыка - это чистый майнкрафт, так что можно смело выключать, хотя она и не напрягает.Вердикт: хотите выживалку? берите The Long Dark. хотите выживалку-кооператив? берите арк или раст. у игры есть потенциал, но он пока не раскрыт. стоит ли она своих денег? ну, по скидке можно и взять, чтобы пару вечеров поплавать с товарищем, но не более того. возможно, это изменится в будущем",N/A
Yayınlanma: 21 Haziran 2020Just so you know when you play on normal difficulty and you die you lose 2/3 of you inventory that means it gets deleted no way of getting it back its just gone on easy you dont get punished for dying over and over again so unless you want meat / trophys you dont need to make weapons,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 20 Haziran 2020I've enjoyed the crafting and building aspect endlessly, but for a legitimate playthrough, three things in particular desperately need to be fixed/rebalanced:1) You should not lose both 2/3rds of your stackable inventory items AND suffer massive durability hits to all of your equipment when you die in Normal mode. A metal spear sustains 20 points of damage from death. At 40 total, that's half its durability. And since it's a fixed amount and not a percentage based on the item's remaining health, death straight up breaks some of your equipment. It takes 2 iron ingots, a bolt, 6 planks, and 2 ropes (i.e. 4 leaves) to make a single metal spear, so dying hits your on-hand inventory, your equipment, AND your storage materials. That seems excessive for Normal difficulty, especially considering there's no way around it in single player. At least provide an option to disable it, or to disable save on death, or just rebalance the item penalties.2) Two of the most practical recipes in the entire game are only obtainable at the very end. You don't get the big backpack recipe until you're already partway through the very last area. Sure, you have a bigger backpack for the gauntlet that is the final area (assuming you have the materials to make it), but what's the point of that? It's not like you can use it to bring extra food, water, arrows and equipment for the final boss fight and exploration, because if you die you'll just lose 2/3rds of all of those stackables and your extra equipment will lose durability without you even getting to use it. The big backpack would've been extremely useful mid-game when you've accumulated a number of recipes (some rather expensive, like the engine and steering wheel), and you're ready to start building out your raft but need tons of materials.Same with the titanium tools recipe. The fact that you only get access to titanium tools AFTER you've collected all the materials you need to build all of the things that you need to get you to the final area and have already completed it makes little sense. Again, these should have become available mid-game, or even late game, but not at the VERY end of the game after you've already done everything.3) No better versions of the rebreather and fins. These are two items that it's hard to avoid using and tedious to not have, yet they're some of the only heavy-use items in the game that don't have a higher durability counterpart.I would love to recommend this game and give it a thumbs up, but I've found that after 40 hours things like this eat away the fun on a regular Normal playthrough.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Haziran 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiBeforehand: I played only single player so far.I'm split about giving a bad review to a game in early access but this game lauched in 2018 and the state it is in is rather confusing for me. Given it was worked on for more then two years and got so many good reviews, I expected somethong completely different. Please do not take this as coplaining. I would have been gratefull to know certain things beforehand and I want to share what I found out so you can check if there are issues that are critical for you. Please note that since this game is early access some matters might be solved in the future.=> Physics and statics as well as other things are not realistic/easy to understand. Examples: The water performs like solid ground when using the hook on it. Your sail will always show the animation of being filled by the wind, even if the raft does sail against the wind. The raft will not sink, no matter what and where you build on it. You can cook and eat food that is clearly declared as being poisonous in the menue. The (better) water purifier (solar based evaporation) works in the night. Plants grow in closed rooms without light.=> You are the raft, not the character! You are not allowed to move the character away far from the initial raft as the world just breaks and you die. Gameplay works by being the raft and the character acting as an arm reaching out for resources. You also cannot just abandon your raft and build a new one.=> There is no world. You can only sail straight as there is no ocean but only a stripe you wander until you hit the spawned destination (raft, island, loot). Afterwards a new stripe spawns and you wander off in the direction the wind gives (aka where the new spawned location ist). There is no navigating or choosing where to go. Only one choice as the game does not let you sail outside of the spawned area (straight left, straight right, back). Also waiting for the wind to change is not an option.=> The setting/gameplay mechanics vs storytelling say two different things. I'm not going into this for spoiler-reasons, but a game should tell a story in whole and not having gameplay mechanics and design ignoring the story. People will not naturally dive into the created world if there is conflicting input.=> Grammar and wording are a mess in the German translation. I must have missclicked as the game installed itself in German and I usually play in Englisch. Anyways, I recommend not playing it in that language. The notes I found on the 1st story island made no sense. Not content-related and not grammatically. I therefore did not play the story further so far. I even had to look up words online as I couldn't find them in the dictionary and althrough German it my mother-tongue.=> There is no tutorial. Which I actually prefere because figuring out things is a lot of fun, especially in survival games. But here it is just frustriating as I found nothing working logically or intuitive. As an expamle: There is a list of controls in the menue but not all controls are included there! (f.ex. the journal which you enter with ""t"" and which is not accessable while in 3rd person mode.). Also you have to literally play piano on your keyboard for things like cooking food. This might be not an issue for experienced PC-players who love their keyboard like nothing in the world, but be aware, people who normally play with a controller or are used to games with well thought of controls: This game takes some time until it does what you want.=> The game is still rather buggy. I died often. Like about 20 times but always due to the game. Few examples: I am on an island and everything despawns (island, raft, shark). I load the game (other world), everything is gone (raft, not shark). I jump on my raft (from the water), I fall through it, get stuck, shark is happy. The shark teleports or hits multiple times, even hits me on the land and upon death, I am suddenly back in the water. Very bad about this is that the game auto-saves upon death so your world is gone.=> 3rd person does not work. As I was told in the forum this mode is basically an addition for cosmetical reasons but since this fact is diplayed nowhere, please be aware that in 3rd person perception and grabbing radius change greatly. Also certain thing do not work (paddle, weapons, journal, most likely diving as you are running on the ground instead and sometimes jumping on the raft from water as you fall through it). The game is easily beatable if you are interested and rely on 3rd person! Also - and this is really amazing in a positive way:  There is a ""seasick"" mode which basically reduces movement. With this on, it is possible to play the game if you are motion sick - even in 1st person for a fair amount of time! Only swiching perspectives is annoying as there is a tendency to turn you 180 degree when changing from 3rd to 1st.=> This is barely a survival game. There is an overflow of all ressources. You basically cannot die of hunger and thirst if you manage the first 5 minutes of the game well and don't hit & get stuck on the first island. You do not run short on supplies - never.  The shark is no threat and can easily be tricked or killed. If you know how survival games work, there is no challenge here. This is a rather relaxed game focusing on building your raft (which is actually fun but does not take long). Just don't plant seeds (unless it's trees). They vanish from the pots no matter how many scarecrows you build - even if you plant indoors!Hope this is helping. In case you do buy the game, I hope you will have fun.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiFrankly the game feels like it's missing some important core elements.First one thing I do not like is that the ocean is all filled with garbage. All right that's how you scavenge for materials, but really it raises the question why is the ocean SO DIRTY? And why only when you o on a certain direction? It breaks suspension of disbelief.Second, aside being filled with garbage the ocean is pretty boring and empty. Sure there is the occasional island and the (so far) 3 locations you can find, bu overall it gets pretty boring pretty quick. After you manage making a few collection nets you have plenty of resources to pimp your raft... but there is no point since you are just sailing into an empty ocean.Third combat is terrible. Now I understand not wanting you to be able to fight the shark effectively, but there other enemies in other locations (like mutant rats - yes really creative...) and even then it's very awkward to fight them and makes the exploration of certain locations simply frustrating and annoying.I understand if my first criticism cannot be fixed, the game hinges on it and that's ok. The third I hope they will fix... but what they really need to do is add more content. The game world feels empty and it gets boring quite quickly.Also I hope they will implement some game-play elements to deal with the shark in better ways. As it is it is ALWAYS a nuisance. It really does not make the game harder, just more annoying and needlessly prolonging the grinding of collecting certain resources like sand or metals.I think there is potential for this game, but as is, I cannot really recommend it.",N/A

It's a shame because the game really seems like something I would like if any small bit of progress I made wasn't almost immediately taken away.I was dying of starvation over and over again because resources were not coming to me, and when you die, you lose what little you did have.Another thing is that more than once, when respawning I did /not/ spawn on my raft, but rather in the water. This got me stuck in a loop of being killed by the shark. This was completely unfixable in one instance so I had to start a new world.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 8 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesithe boars ai is insanely hard to beat and is impossible to get away from because it never stops chasing you. as soon as you see one the only option is to leave the island fully because you can never lose him. if you go to a different part of the island or jump off of something, he will just pathfind a way to you and keep chasing you, and theres nothing you can do to stop it.i would recommend to just completely avoid big islands unless you have the highest level gear in the game, because the creatures in this game have insane ai and take a huge amount of hits to kill even with the best weapons in the game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 6 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiDISCAIMER: Recommended for new players playing with friendsNot much to do outside of story. But has potential.The main gameplay issue with the game is that you spend most of your time not exploring and just going strait forwards out at sea, trying to get more wood to build cool looking things. If the devs made it so that trees drop more wood or that you find more naturally generating islands then the game would be far better. But at the moment it feels like a grind to get even raft foundation.Don't get me wrong, with a lot of friends, the early game can be a great laugh and a ton of fun, but the later parts of the game (around about when you go to Vasagatan) the game becomes a chore to progress.Would still recommend for new players you want a good time with friends",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 4 Mayıs 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesi19 hours played at time of review. Completed all storyline quests. Great concept, but weighed down heavily by a severe durability system with no repair function, imbalanced resource gathering and agonising smelting system.I found myself constantly short on planks due to having to feed just about every crafting system in the game with planks. What made this worse was landing on islands full of trees that could not be harvested with the axe, as only mango trees and palm trees can be harvested - which yield tiny amounts of planks. Some small items cost more wood than you can get out of harvesting an entire palm tree (like the birds nest). This broke immersion quite a bit for me and made the game feel like a constant grind. Hoping the devs read this and consider a few minor balance shifts that could make this a great game.5/10. Recommended if on sale, or if you really enjoy grinding and re-creating broken items that can't be repaired.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 25 Nisan 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiFriend gifted me this game a while back, perhaps a year ago. The 3.4 hours I have currently logged is all me and him playing, and we pretty much got all out of the game that you could get out of it at the time which is just expand your raft, float around, collect resources, rinse, repeat until you reach the ""ending""Which is extremely basic as well. You find a beacon of sorts which points you towards this massive wreckage and that's it. You explore it, get some stuff and done. If memory serves me right, the sea levels rose or something along the lines of that and that's how you ended up here. You can easily get this ending in under 5 hours, so your essentially paying £15 for a bare boned game that has been in early access for 2 years now.I still have hope for this game, and wish that when it fully releases there will be more to do, but for now, its going to have to be a negative from me.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 6 Nisan 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiI bought this game as i usually enjoy similar types of games however, I have developed mixed feelings for this game. Firstly that shark is so annoying, constantly having to rebuild the raft after it destroys random parts no matter what i do and then being unable to enter the water for longer than a few minutes at a time to seek any resources that may be under water as the shark will attack and kill you very quickly makes the game become a drag. The seagulls attacking the crops is true to real life I guess, to which you can craft a scarecrow to stop this, the problem however is that the seagulls then attack and break the scarecrow meaning you have to spend most of your time grinding for hours to collect various bits of salvage required to craft constantly breaking items, paying constant attention to the shark and seagulls and ensuring you have enough food and water on the go at all times to survive.A positive to this game is that it has a great and interesting story however this story takes a fair amount of time to get started if you don't know what you're doing, and a major negative to this is that travelling to each location requires you to use sails to direct your raft in the correct direction, which is a nice feature, however i keep encountering a glitch where there is no salvage at all in the water thus leaving me having to constantly drift in the wrong direction to collect as many planks as possible before sailing towards the next story location.As I said before i really do enjoy this game, but from time to time however some of these problems are becoming so boring and repetitive it is beginning to make it difficult to enjoy just playing. I completely understand this game is in early access and i'm excited to see what is to come from the developers however there are some key points that need to be addressed quickly like the fact there is no permanent way to stop the shark attacking the raft or the constant glitches that make playing the game ridiculously hard.All in all i find it hard to recommend this game to anyone at full price for the time being because of the random glitches, a few annoying features that make it difficult to play after a while and the constant grinding, but I do feel it has great potential and will be a great game when fully released with it being a great take on the survival genre with an amazing atmosphere and gripping story.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 Mart 2020I love the idea of this game, survival at sea and building your raft bigger and bigger. I did enjoy the game for that yes, however, once you start doing the story, you will probably find it interesting at first, but as it goes on and on, city after city, it just starts becoming stale and less and less interesting.Ok spoiler alert for those who careOnce you reach the Utopia, you will be met with some bs bomb dodging area and a stupid overgrown hyena fight, this concept alone kind of ruined the game for me, and once you defeat them, you get ALL of the best items at the very end, like the best hook, sword etc. and once you are done, that is it. There is no reason to play anymore. I don't get why are you given the best items at the very end when once you are done, there is nothing else to do but build your raft. You won't probably go to islands or cities anymore since there is barely any reason to go there. As the story went on the game became less and less about survival and more and more of solving puzzles.Before you ask, you are kind of forced to play the story if you want to upgrade your raft since most upgrades and additions are locked behind each ""chapter"" of the story.It would've been cool if once you beat the game, Utopia sort of became some HQ where you are given quests or something to go fetch or rescue some people or something like that, you know, a reason to continue on playing.I honestly do not want give this game a thumbs down, like I said, I really enjoyed it at the start when the survival was the main focus, however that stopped being the case as the game went on.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Şubat 2020Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game itself is quite nice. The scenery is quite nice. There are islands to explore, loot to collect, and things that make progression and expansion quite fulfilling. At some point though, that progress is often hindered by the games poor optimization. Expanded your raft, while it may seem like a good idea; often affects framerate in unexpected ways. I use a 1060 with 16 gigs of ram, and yet even with only a mere 98 foundations; the game runs at a near constant 5 to 15 fps. The worst part is, is that the game should not be that graphically intensive (aka, should not use 100% of my gpu on the lowest settings possible). The game is okay in the end, but it is truly hard to play at that framerate. I don't know if this is an issue for others, but for what I have seen is that people with better specs than I have are having trouble running this game. In the end, what I can say is this: if you like survival games with the ability to build upon what you already have; then this game is for you, but keep in mind that the game may be barely playable due to framerate, or completely unplayable if you cannot handle less than 15 fps consistently.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 14 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI know it is early access, but the coding for the multiplayer of this game is just too bad. The game not only crashes frequently, but when I rejoin the world that is hosted by my friend, the items I got in the last few minutes are lost and I respawn at some location i was at previously. This also makes it possible to duplicate items by just putting them in a chest and waiting for it to crash.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 7 Aralık 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe early game is not very fun. You begin on a TINY raft with a great white shark standing right beneath, and the shark will not leave your side, ever. (If you kill it you earn 24h of peace or so before another shark takes its place.) So the early game is sort of just... Standing there, trying not to fall off this tiny platform into the shark-infested water, grabbing the few ressources you can get with your hook because you don't dare swim to them. Not very fun. If the shark's presence was intermittent (on and off, and you have to watch for sign of whether it is there or not) it would make the game more fun, easier at first, and yet more stressful. (You get desensitized to the constant threat.)Other fun-killing issues I encountered :-It's way too hard to climb back on the raft when you fall into the water. The raft moves fast. You have to swim and jump around and try to fall back on the raft which is absurd. There should be an option to just grab it and lift yourself up onto it.-Weird scarcity of some ressources like stone. Step 1: get lucky enough to get some random stones from a barrel floating by. Step 2 : make anchor with the stone to stay near an island, figuring there will be stone there. Step 3 : Find 0 stone neither in the shallow waters nor on the ground of the ROCKY island ??? Step 4 : leave without having been able to make a stone axe to collect plants on the island, and without the ability to make an anchor for the next one.-Seagulls keep attacking my plants despite myself and a scarecrow being RIGHT THERE. Scarecrows shouldn't even be necessary when players are right next to the plants, and they should hopefully work a little bit better.Afterwards when you have more ressources it becomes more fun although the mechanics of moving the raft around become pretty weird and actually made me very seasick, lol.Fun with a friend but still needs a lot of work.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 23 Kasım 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiHard mode is no more about you died, you can't respawn. It's normal and usually is this what ""hard"" means. But in Raft you are not able enjoy the game if you playing solo and figh at begging of game with two sharks which attack very often. You're done. I played Raft since early game, but this is not funny anymore. It's just pain and agony for solo gamer who love permanent dead.If you playing this game on hard diff. you're finished even if you still alive...Maybe they thought that if we didn't call it a bug, but the update, maybe it would work like in Minecraft, but ... no, I don't think so guys.

"Yayınlanma: 19 Kasım 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiRaft is a cute. fairly relaxing game but there isnt much to it.  You collect scrap that floats by and build things.  Thats about it.  Its like the movie waterworld without the fun bandits and other challenges.  You simply exist to collect and build.  You pretty much do all that your going to realistically do in the first 10 minutes of game play.  Sure, the recipes get just a ""bit"" more complex(gotta have sand before you can have bricks before you can make a smelter, etc., etc.,) but the premise is exactly and totally boringly the same for the whole game as it is in the first 10 minutes of the game.  As far as the sharks and seagulls and other ""threats""?  I found them more annoying than threatening.  Im not sure that they add much to the game.  Dealing with them does take you away from the grind of collecting and building for a moment once and awhile so I guess thats good?

"Yayınlanma: 16 Kasım 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game struggles with an identity crisis. At first glance it looks like a buildning, survival, exploring game. But it's neither. There are far to few build options to be a buildning game. Survival is trivial past the first day or so. And every island is more or less the same so there isn't really anything to explore.To have something for you to do there are ""distractions"" forced upon you. Every few minutes a random part of your raft will be destroyed by a shark, unless you run there an click on it in time. Also every few minutes or so a random of your crops will be destroyed, unless you run there to chase away a sea gull. Eating and drinking have diminishing returns which means that filling yourself up just wastes resources, instead you need to eat, drink and prepare food and water regularly. Nothing of this is either challenging, exciting or rewarding, it's just tiresome.Still, it has potential. It's fun to unlock new tech and to find the first island or two. But you do that in a few hours. After that you move to endgame, which mainly give you more food options. But you've been eating since day 1 so, yay?Buy it and play with your friends a few days, after that your're kinda done with it.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 18 Eylül 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiNow before I start to rant of all the things that make this game terrible I want to point out that the game is very enjoyable when you look past all the flaws, I've spent a good amount of hours on this game and probably will continue to spend more hours on it but there are certain things that irk me and if changed could really take this game from a 2/10 all the way to a 10/10, that's how bad these things are.Pros - Cute character design and model designs for the animals. The fact that you need food and water is nice. The new take on surviving out in the ocean is truly enjoyable. Multiplayer adds a new depth that made this game so much fun. There was a lot to explore and the ocean always gave me chills. The enemy's, when not being annoyingly aggressive, are fun and give different challenges for each kind.Cons - The decay rate on your food and water bar are truly terrible, you cant go five minutes without needing to worry about starving or dehydrating. The Shark enemy that follows you EVERYWHERE attacks every 5 minutes and destroys your raft, there is no break, there is no peace, even when you are exploring on islands the shark will tear your raft to pieces while you are not there to defend it. Animals starve too fast, if you miss one day they die, and its expensive to catch them since you don't get your nets back and the net gun has durability, you don't have time to do anything else except water your animals once you have them. The battery's die in less than five minutes, again the decay rates for everything in this game are just horrible. Due to the fast decay rates and the shark constantly attacking your boat this game isn't a nice relaxed survival, you have to do everything fast and you have to always be going a hundred miles an hour and its sadly exhausting.Small Complaints - Minor side note, play the game in motion sickness mode or else your boat will dunk under the water quite often which can lead to you being pushed into the sea and left behind. As far as I was able to tell there is no ending, which is okay but I feel like a game like this should wrap up to you finding some safe haven or something. I wish there was more diverse ocean life to make the oceans feel more alive. You can't set up base on any island which I guess is fine since the game is called raft but your raft can be totally destroyed and you could be left with nothing, no home point, no safe location, nothing, its all procedurally generated so there is no map, there is no going back.The things I pointed out are some of the really big ones that you cant really overlook when playing a game, and for a game that's 20 bucks normally it sure feels like they can do better, I know they can and I hope that they fix these problems so that the game is more enjoyable for everyone!Would I Recommend? - Sadly with the way the game is now I cannot say I would recommend it to anyone. If they fix the problems I stated, this game could easily become a 10/10.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 13 Ağustos 2019Erken Erişim İncelemesiI have a super computer, nothing has ever crashed it before, but somehow this game has managed to crash at the worst times, usually after you just accomplish something or find a random floating raft. having so much fun.......... The game is an eating and drinking sim, the amount of times i have to consume water and food is outright ridiculous. Your character weighs maybe 120-135. They have to consume 15 lbs of fish a day to stay alive,  and a minimum of 20 cups of water, like on my best day i couldn't consume that much fish and water, add in super janky controls and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shark that defys all logic. you got yourself a recipe for  Raft.  A little more explanation on the research table would be nice, took me 15 hours to finally realize you have to research the plank and other base materials not just blueprints, they have the dumbest popup browser reroute from hell in the pause menu.  another issue is why do i have to do 5 minutes of storage prep to execute a recipe, The fact you cant access storage items when building things is POSSIBLY the biggest crime of all. Its like all the other ♥♥♥♥ wasnt bad enough they had to go the extra mile and be extra douchey and not allow storage access when building, the game turns into one big headache of eat,drink, and make room in your absolutely terrible size inventory to build or accomplish anything, its a tragedy, it really is because the game is good, minus these blaring loud issues, don't hope to accomplish anything you'll be busy eating drinking and adjusting your inventory. I'm going to attempt a play on easy and hopefully this will clear up some of the issues. Normally i would never stoop as low as to play a game outside of what was intended but NORMAL IS NOT NORMAL, its a eating and drinking sim plauged by planks.

There is no repairing them for a nominal material cost.  You have to make new ones when they break.The Plastic Hook is only good for 40 gathering uses, then you have to make a new one. It will probably take you 3 uses to get the materials to make that new hook.  Less if you're lucky.The wooden Spear is only good for 20 uses before breaking.  Worst case it will take 14 hook uses to get the materials to make it.  Then you can use it to start driving off the shark which tries to snack on your Raft every few minutes.  You won't be able to kill it with just 1 spear though.  It takes 30 hits with the Wood Spear to kill the shark on normal.Hours later, (once you've made it far past the early skin of your teeth feeling grind) all the basic resources are easy to acquire with a decently sized raft at least 25% covered in gathering nets.  I don't know how fast anyone else is at building up their raft to that point but it takes me more than a few hours to get to that point.Be warned about the extreme frustration you're probably going to feel early on.  Constantly breaking tools.  A shark that uses your raft as a chew toy and if you don't stop him he tears a piece off.So be warned about this frustration making you hate the game and want to quit.

The idea is great but nothing works right, so many bugs and issues and reporting them doesn't seem to do any good.

Maybe one day they will do a major update of bug fixes and stuff but until then, I do not recommend this game to anyone, especially at the rate they charge for it. I paid half that for the best game I ever played.UPDATE Nov 25, 2022:I still hesitate to change my review to a full recommend because there are still a lot of things that drive me crazy about the game. Like how the shark is just non stop attacking, and swimming around the raft to make it a complete pain to go diving in the reefs. The rate at which stuff breaks and how often you have to eat and drink, is still ridiculous. One thing though that has improved in a lot of the bugs.

"Yayınlanma: 24 Ekim 2018Raft is two games merged into one. The first is a sandbox raft building and resources gathering game. You collect materials from the ocean and randomly spawning islands to improve your raft and help you survive. The second is an adventure game where you go to story islands, solve puzzles and deal with occasional combat. The first is a fun and engaging experience, the second is tedious and mediocre at best.Pros:- Raft building: The raft building is fun and there is a wide variety of building options and items to populate your ship with. The ship parts all connect to one another and there are no issues with things not quite joining right or looking bad. The items you need on your ship require a decent amount of space so there is motivation to build something more than just a tiny raft. You can also build multiple stories high.- Resource collection: its fun and a bit addictive. The funnest part of this game is just visiting small islands and grabbing all the resources and watching your ship grow over time. Once you collect the raw materials some need to be processed into finished goods with adds something to do while you are going from island to island. Its a good core gameplay loop.- Visual design and music: both are quite good. The visuals are stylised but in a nice way, and the music never feels repetitive (that said I do play with lower music volume).- Variety: The amount of different randomly spawning islands is quite good. Once you play the game for a while you will have seen them all but there are enough that even if you play for a long time they don't feel repetitive.Cons:- Story: Unfortunately the devs decided that the story element should take place on vast islands (in all but one case), which means you spent all this time building a cool raft - then you get off it and do nothing with it for hours at a time while you explore the current story island. What is worse is that your motivation for doing so is completely unclear - the story seems to not involve you or have anything at all to do with you so god knows why you are going to these islands in the first place. It kinda feels like the devs ran out of ideas for things to do with the raft so they started making a completely different game on land.- Arbitrary puzzles: The way to progress the story islands is usually by way of solving some puzzle or similar but the way its designed is completely arbitrary. It often seems to be increasingly bizarre ways of solving relatively simple problems which brings to mind adventure games from the 90s but with none of the charm. The end result is that you are just clicking and grabbing a bunch of stuff with no real idea about what goal you are even trying to achieve, because the end of each island is just a random post it note with the code for the next one. How the hell the character knew to find that note through the series of actions they took is an exercise left to the reader.- Combat: The combat is pretty bare bones and rather wonky. Its never been a big deal in the earlier parts of the game because the combat is a small part of the game, but in later story stages it takes more centre stage with some boss fights and the result is predictably mediocre.Overall - when the game was in early access before the story islands it was a promising sandbox game, unfortunately that side of the game has barely progressed and almost all the effort in early access has been on the story side which quite frankly has been a waste of time. Unfortunately there is just not enough of the raft sandbox experience to make it worth recommending, and hopefully another group of devs will exploit this missed opportunity.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 26 Eylül 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is not a hardcore survival game by any means, there is no real level of depth to this game. The good reviews are all true, it really is a chill (slow) survival game. Its experience is similar to subnautica, but only the first 20 mins replayed over and over.The adventour, and exploration in the game is as simple as letting your pc idle until an island appears, or a scrap raft appears in the distance. The shark never goes away, and is constantly annoying. Even as a chill survival game im  more worried about not being able to build on anything besides my raft for the most part and forgetting its floating away as I collect stuff from the islands to get to the ""end game"".     If your easily entertained and want to play a slow, easy lazy river simulator where you collect trash then get this game. If your wanting a surreal survival experience with crafting and a little bit of a harder learning curve and harder gameplay get stranded deep (as thats pretty much all we have atm).",N/A

The debris is stationary, if you stop moving so does it.As is, mechanically it's not that great of a game. 4/10",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 22 Eylül 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiIn 2018 I wrote a review recommending Raft. With content added since then I'd say it... needs work. The game is often more frustrating than it is fun. For example, we found a ""large"" island full of bears yesterday, on which we were meant to complete a puzzle to get some reward. I put ""large"" in quotations, because it wasn't actually that big, but the level design made it feel a lot larger due to tedium.The puzzles are just finding random items that the game tells you are required to complete that stage of the puzzle(for example, the locked door will literally tell you that you need a red key to open it, before you've even discovered the item). The way the puzzles are designed means you end up doing a lot of backtracking through the level, through enemies with low respawn timers which make the puzzles drag on even longer because you might have to go back to your raft and craft new weapons in the middle of it(repairing items still isn't a thing 3 years later). There was a small crashed cruise ship we found that I think we must have wandered back and forth on unlocking doors and whatnot for like 2 hours. It's just very tedious, and you'll be running around this artificially long puzzle running out of food and water and weaponry, and seagulls will destroy your scarecrows and your crops all the while, and you'll be unable to recoup your losses the entire time because you can't get things unless your raft is moving. You can't harvest 99.9% of trees on the large island, there's no food to be found. You can't build anything or destroy any obstacles on land that might make it easier or more enjoyable. When you're finally done with all that, hopefully you have enough wood left to fuel your engines(which eat through it like crazy as does almost literally every other station, EVERYTHING requires wood and there's simply not enough of it) or you'll have to drift around the ocean randomly for a couple hours before you can continue on your way... which stops being enjoyable after like 15 hours of gameplay.It's just a bit of a mess right now.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 17 Ağustos 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiUpdate: (January 5th 2020)I came back to Raft a little over a year after my initial playthrough to play with a different friend and check out the new content. The new content is basically just two new story areas that are underwhelming. They don't really add much except to eat your time up. Ironically, right before we even got to the content I felt myself starting to be ready for the playthrough to end. This game is okay, but there are just many better survival games out there that have kept me interested longer than this one. And the new content was not worth a replay at all.-Original review: (August 2018)I played Raft as a co-op game with a buddy and overall we had fun. However, there is a reason this game is labeled as early access. It lacks content. The beginning of the game keeps you busy and can be tense as you try to survive, but in all reality the game has a basic loop of grabbing the same few basic items for the majority of the game.Despite this, I did enjoy my time with the game, but I cannot recommend it because it feels incomplete in its current state.** Spoilers ahead** (As minor as they are)The end game is to craft a few items to help you navigate to a radio tower, and you think, ""Okay, here we go."" But no, it is just a room that has a board with a few hints that this game takes place after a global warming event where the ice caps have melted. And that's it. Achievement unlocked and either keep going and building your raft for the hell of it or just turn off the game.",N/A
Yayınlanma: 10 Ağustos 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThe game is a rather Unique idea. I like the building and the gathering. I even liked the challenge of the game. What I don't like is the game lags hard even with a gtx 1080. I also didn't like the forum moderator who says it has nothing to do with the game only the raft size even though it can happen with a very small raft. Also didn't like the fact my post outlining the issue must have been deleted because it's no longer in my post history. Keep your 20 bucks and play something else. If they finally get over it's not our fault it's your fault attitude and introduce some patches maybe this game will be ok. Will update if that ever happens.,N/A

"Yayınlanma: 15 Temmuz 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis game is not bad, but is not worth 21.99 and a 9/10 title. Essentialy all you can do is basically, build a raft and that's pretty much it I know there is a bit more but I feel like this game (more spesific single player) doesn't have much to offer. The multiplayer makes this game more fun since you have a buddy to build and survive throughout the days, but I don't also get why it's called masively multiplayer when you don't get to meet new people and play with whoever in your 'friends' own this game. Generally, a lot people including new users like me don't have any friends/ friends playing this game.On the bright side, I find many aspects of this game like exploring underwater for more effecient recourses or going on islands to explore pretty cool and creative.Let's talk about the different modes:The creative mode; makes it more boring, espically when the only aspect of fun of this game is the survival. Unless your making a contest of whos boat is bigger, although survival seems more for fun for that case. I don't see why you should add creative mode. I know this game is still having development througout Early Access I don't get why it's so overrated.",N/A

You can't really explore on your own. Rather, you just wait for things to randomly show up, and the things that show up are pretty uniform throughout the game, so there isn't much development there.Could be a lot more fun if the basic game mechanics are changed so tasks aren't so repetative",N/A

If this changes in the future, or if more options beyond easy/hard lite/hard are added, I plan on revisiting this review.

"Yayınlanma: 21 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiOriginally this was a fun casual survival game in an open watery world.End game achievements, however, consist of a series of enormous grinds - hook 5000 items, survive 365 days (x 24 minutes), visit 50 large islands (x 30 minutes), kill 200 animals at a rate of 3-4 per island, place 1000 foundations tiles..Developer's efforts has plummeted with achievements being added 4 months ahead of content being implemented and there's nothing to do but float for the majority of time spent online - and a Facebook Group nobody asked for where only the admins can post threads.After you've spent 15 mins paddling to the next large island sometimes they despawn for no reason and you have to change course and spend another 15 mins paddling to a new location.When you get to the islands there's a chance there's no birds at all (at most there's just 2) - and 50% of the time the kills only count for the host due to the abismal codingLastly the game is still very badly optimised especially on larger Rafts.

But during this you better be drinkin', better be fishin'. Because your hunger and thrist go down WAY too fast. I felt the casual-ness of 'easy' was too easy. and than, the normal difficulty being too strict. After wandering around (and surviving for) an hour and a half. I had, a 3x3 ship, with a sail, grill, and water purifier. I felt as if that was all i really needed. Expanding my ship was way too expenisive when I have to fuel my purifier and grill with wood.I infact, encountered two islands. Both I couldn't dock on, and I couldn't even climb on too! After wasting valuable sources on an anchor (that I can only use once) I was just. stuck. A half hour later, I made a bed, killed a shark. and found another island. same thing, cant climb onto shore.I felt like I had all I needed in just an hour and a half.Maybe i got bad RNG, maybe there is more.

"Yayınlanma: 29 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiThis is a good game but its not worth its current £15.  Having bought 2 copy's to play co-op with the misses and spending 10 hours getting to the end game we are both frustrated that there is no ending.Once you get to a point after building the receiver & following it , you will know when you get there, the game just runs out of content with no point of continuing.   I'm guessing the dev's are working on this but as it stands I cannot recommend.When, or should I say if, they add an ending giving you some drive to continue after having enough food and water to feed a small population then yes, I would recommend this game.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 1 Haziran 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiИгра очень рана выпущена ей надо еще поработать над собой.Тоесть множество багов и лагов.Цепляет игра(тоесть интересна игроку) на часов 5 и то если играть по мультиплееру.База о который все говорили лично я нашел и там нету нечего там дают тебе 3-4 ящик такие же как на островах интересного там нечего.Кроме магнитной доски там рассказывают,что и как.Пример: Что произошло?. Стоит-ли игра 420 рублей.Нет!Игра скучная после 3-5часов игры в нее.Ждите пока она будет допиливаться потому берите.",N/A

"Yayınlanma: 30 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiEvery 3 to 5 minutes whatever raft or island i would be standing on would just disappear and I would fall into the water. Will come back when the game is playable.From the few minutes I was able to play the game seems to still be in its infancy, there didn't appear to be a ton of content.",N/A

Yayınlanma: 27 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiInteresting idea but the game needs so much work to be enjoyable. Resource acquisition is obnoxious and a complete lack of instructions for concepts in the game make it difficult to get going. Haven't even managed to get drinkable water or food to eat before the meters run all the way down.,N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 Mayıs 2018This game can't decide it it wants to be a relaxing raft building game or a violent survival game and fails at both. The raft building is great, until you need materials from an island and then homocidal warthogs and birds just murder you in 3 hits, two warthogs will stunlock you to death. The framerate is bad, the physics is bad, and you will die and lose 2/3rds of your intentory.I wish the devs had stuck with ""nice raft builder"" rather than inflict this painfully badly designed fighting portion of the game on the player.",N/A
"Yayınlanma: 25 Mayıs 2018Erken Erişim İncelemesiAt the moment content is not worth 20$.I was very hyped at the beginning, bought it 2h after steam release with my friend. It was exciting to expand our little raft, first shark kill, first few islands... and... that's it. 10h and we were done, after that we could go afk and let the nets do their job, come back, build few walls and afk again. Updates should be more frequently, even one item per week would make it way better.I can't get my money back, so I hope devs are planning big update and I'll come back with smile on my face cause now i'm a sad panda.",N/A
